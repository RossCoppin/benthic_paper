The "fauna" file contains all biomass (grams) measurements for faunal species at Bordjies, Oudekraal and Betty's Bay. 
The "flora" file contains all biomass measurements (grams) for floral species at Bordjies, Oudekraal and Betty's Bay.
The "kelp_ar" file contains kelp counts of adults and juveniles at Bordjies, Oudekraal and Betty's Bay.
The "cover" file contains %cover estimates for Bordjies, Oudekraal and Betty's Bay. The categories are sand, foliose,
encrusting corraline (cc), mussel, silt and sponge. 

The data contain three levels which are "site", "plot" and "id". 
The site label is the name allocated to the study site. 
The plot label has a corresponding letter for the study site (B for Bordjies, O for Oudekraal and Y
for Betty's Bay) and a number refering to the plot number (either 1 or 2).
The id label is the quadrat number. The quadrat number spans all three sites. 

This folder should contain two files in total. They are "kelp_ar" and "kelp_length".

The file kelp_ar contains all kelp counts of recruit and adults for E. maxima at Bordjies Reef, Oudekraal and
Betty's Bay, in wide format.

The kelp_length file contains all kelp stipe measurments for adult E. maxima. The kelp individual was also 
classified as "canopy" if it reached the surface, "sub-canopy" if it was at least 1m from the surface and 
"recruit" refers to an kelp individual that is still considered a recruit. 

The data contains three levels which are "site", "plot" and "id". 
The site label is the name allocated to the study site. 
The plot label has a corresponding letter for the study site (B for Bordjies, O for Oudekraal and Y
for Betty's Bay) and a number refering to the plot number (either 1 or 2).
The id label is the quadrat number. The quadrat number ranged over all three sites.
