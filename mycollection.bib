@article{Limbaugh1955,
abstract = {This final report is the result of research during the five and one-half year period from September 1948 to March 1954. Throughout the investigation the apparent decline of sport fish was causing sport fishermen great concern. Among other factors, kelp harvesting was blamed for the poor catch of the sportsman. More than a year after the beginning of this investigation, the Kelco Company approached the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California, with the request that the problems of kelp cutting in relation to the fish supply be attacked by the University under a fellowship grant, by unprejudiced research. The Company wanted to determine whether the kelp operations were adversely affect­ing fishing, and if so, how harvesting methods might be altered to prevent this. The first phase of the program was concerned with observation and identification. Thousands of hours were spent above and below the surface observing the organisms in their own environment. Extensive use was made of scuba diving equipment for observations, collection, and placing of equipment. Underwater photography was developed to a point where many observations could be recorded. The second phase of the program was to appraise the effects of kelp harvesting on fish life. Because of the lack of pertinent published data on the ecology of the inshore waters, it was necessary to investigate not only the beds of the main commercial kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), but also many other regions, in order to obtain comparative data. Such areas included bays, rocky areas below the levels where kelp grows, rocky areas with no kelp, the surf zones, sandy areas, and regions outside the West Coast range of Macrocystis. Kelp beds were studied as far north as Monterey and as far south as the San Benito Islands, Baja California. Diving observations in the kelp were made at Monterey, Morro Bay, Goleta, Santa Barbara, Point Dume, Palos Verdes, Newport, Laguna, Dana Point, San Clemente, Del Mar, Solana Beach, La Jolla, Point Loma, Ensenada, Punta San Carlos, Punta Blanca, Punta Santa Rosalia, and numerous other points along the mainland; also at San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Catalina, Coronado, San Martin, and San Benito Islands. Intensive studies of the problem were carried out in Orange and San Diego Counties, with special concentra­tion on the nearby La Jolla kelp beds. One portion of the La Jolla kelp beds was left uncut as a control. Little difference has been noted in the fish life within the bed as contrasted with harvested beds. The kelp itself became more sparse, probably because of reduced light penetration through the heavy canopy that developed tem­porarily. In the 1952-53 winter season much of the kelp was de­stroyed by storms. These studies yielded a vast amount of information bearing not only on the kelp problem but also on the life ways of the fishes. As a result of these long and thorough studies, it is concluded that kelp harvesting, as cutrrently practiced, has no seriously detrimental effects on fishing. The various claims as to the ways in which kelp harvesting was supposed to destroy fish life and to decrease the fish catch were completely investi­gated and found to be in error. Spawning and nursery grounds of fish are not being destroyed. Sufficient cover and food are always available during and after harvesting. The kelp beds are not destroyed by harvesting methods. Harvesters do not frighten sportfish from an area. For several decades California has experienced a tremendous increase in population. Cities have grown where deserts and foothills were the homes of deer, rabbits, ground squirrels, ground owls, doves,and quail. In most places these animals have largely disappeared, and with them the intertidal mollusks — Pismo clams, butter clams, abalone, and many other species. The shore fishes such as corbina and spotfin croaker are less common in the individual fisherman's catch. Over kelp beds where a man might have fished alone a decade or two ago, we may see 50 sport boats with a total of 1000 anglers. Thus, even though the annual catch may be the same as or higher than 10 or 20 years ago, the catch per fisherman is much lower. The kelp industries have arisen indirectly from our social-economic needs for new raw materials to fill new markets. They have become established in our economy and are essential for the production of certain new products. As is typical of modern, young industries, they have conducted research to determine the maximum sustained yield. The industry naturally has no desire to destroy kelp. The sportfishing industry is large and provides recreation, necessary for our nation's health, to thousands of persons. With the addition of thou­sands of newcomers to sportfishing and the reduction of catch per unit of effort, it is not difficult to understand the fishermen's concern over factors supposedly destroying their sport. It is necessary, however, to determine the real reason for the apparent decline of fish before any constructive action can be taken. It may be a problem of overfishing or of natural population fluctuations, but the blame cannot be laid to the kelp harvesting.},

abstract = {1. Aqualung dives along the open coast south of Carmel, California, have been made over a period of two years.2. The predominant kelp on the open coast in the Monterey area is Nereocystis luetkeana; the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is scarce. Nereocystis is an annual plant producing a heavy subsurface canopy in the summer months.3. Inshore water is deep; the granite walls drop to a depth of 10 to 30 feet. A dense growth of the branching red coralline alga Calliarthron cheilosporioides carpets the immediate subtidal rocks to a depth of 10 feet, to the exclusion of most sessile animals.4. Below this zone large Laminaria setchellii replace Calliarthron and a profusion of sponges and tunicates occurs on the walls. The rock bottom at depths of 20 to 50 feet supports a forest of the perennial kelp Pterygophora californica which produces a subsurface canopy.5. A typical Nereocystis plant presents 70 square feet and a Pterygophora plant 18 square feet of light absorbing area (on one side).6. The most abundant large invertebrates are an anemone, Anthopleura xanthogrammica, the gum boot chiton, Cryptochiton stelleri, and the bat star, Patiria miniata.7. Laminaria and Pterygophora stipes and holdfasts provide important microhabitats for many small animals.8. Large urchins, Stronglyocentrotus franciscanus, are absent. California sea otters are known to prey heavily upon this species, probably accounting for its local extinction. I suspect that the absence of this urchin allows the luxuriance of algae and sessile fauna that is observed.9. A total of 248 species from the sublittoral zone in this locality is listed.},

Regression lines and prediction limits for organic C from loss-on-ignition are given from the data obtained. Although these regressions are not necessarily expected to be generally applicable, examination of some published data suggests that closely similar expressions may be.

abstract = {Maternal effects arise when a mother's phenotype or the environment she experiences influences the phenotype of her progeny. Most studies of adaptive maternal effects are a "snapshot" of a mother's lifetime offspring provisioning and do not generally consider the effects of earlier siblings on those produced later. Here we show that in soil mites, offspring provisioning strategies are dynamic, changing from an emphasis on egg number in young females to egg size in older females. This pattern may be adaptive if it increases the survival of younger offspring that must compete with older, larger siblings. The dynamic shift in egg provisioning was greater in high-food environments in which females lived longer, creating increasing asymmetry in offspring competitive abilities. Females reared in isolation and in the presence of a high-density colony had identical provisioning strategies, suggesting that, unlike males in this species, females do not use pheromones to assess colony size. Our findings suggest that the adaptive significance of maternal effects may be misinterpreted when studies consider only a snapshot of a female's offspring provisioning strategy or when components of the offspring provisioning strategy are studied in isolation.},

abstract = {As part of an ecological investigation of the kelp holdfast fauna in northeast Britain, research has been made into the physical conditions responsible for the ecologically significant 'sediment factor'. Bottom-mounted apparatus at Robin Hood's Bay and Flamborough Head (Yorkshire, England) has been used to study fluctuations in sediment deposition. Membrane filtration of sea water has given data on suspended material. The total dry weight of deposited sediment has been related to prevailing onshore winds (in excess of 6.6 m/sec) and turbulence. The coarseness of the sediment deposited is proportional to the total sample dry weight. Sediment sorting is shown to vary according to the relative contribution of the particle size range incorporating a median diameter of 180 ??m. 'Organic' content of deposited sediment fluctuated seasonally, with highest values after the settlement of detritus during periods of summer calm. Suspended solids showed a marked seasonal variation with high values in winter and low values in summer. Statistical analysis, has enabled a grouping of months into two significantly different periods, i.e. 'summer' and 'winter' to be made. A generally comparable seasonal trend in suspended solids has been observed over a two year period. A multiple linear regression equation is presented, linking suspended solids at Robin Hood's Bay with the environmental parameters of sea state, tidal range, and river flow: the regression accounts for 28 {\%} of the total variance. Sea state is shown to be the single most important factor influencing suspended solids. The ecological significance of the environmental complex governing the expression of a 'sediment factor' is discussed in relation to the kelp fauna. The difficulty of accurately interpreting data on faunal dynamics is outlined in the light of these and other factors. The suggestion is made that such data would be of little use in an assessment of temporally changing pollution effects. ?? 1972.},

abstract = {Postelsia palmaeformis is an annual brown alga that occurs on the Washington coast at upper intertidal sites subjected to extreme wave exposure. The alga occurs in patches within beds of Mytilus californianus, the competitive dominant in this region. Postelsia sporophytes are shown to colonize experimentally cleared spaces in beds of Mytilus with no concurrent colonization of adjacent uncleared controls. However, unlike many annual algae which have high spore dispersal abilities, Postelsia seems to have an effective distance of sporophyte colonization of only about 3 m from the edge of existing Postelsia patch. This limited spore dispersal is the mechanism postulated to explain the observed within-patch aggregated distribution also. Postelsia patches are maintained through time by settlement of Postelsia on other algal and animal species. By increasing the probability of both being ripped from the substraturm, and by overgrowing and smothering barnacles, Postelsia sporophytes clear primary substratum for the eventual use of sporophytes of their own species.},

Several restrictions to widespread use of the model limit its application to laboratory studies, but its general concepts may apply to natural water situations.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which various species exert influence disproportionate to their abundance or mass on the structure of a lower intertidal algal community were evaluated experimentally. These functional roles were evaluated by various controlled manipulations at seven stations along the Washington coastline ranked according to an exposure/desiccation gradient. The algae were divided into three categories: canopy species, which grow above the other species and apparently succeed in competitively dominating the light resources as dem- onstrated by algal blooms following their removal; obligate understory species, which die after the canopy species are removed; and fugitive species, which are quick to colonize new space. Ecological dominance was exerted in areas of moderate wave exposure by Hedophyllum sessile, which competitively displaces a large number of fugitive algal species and which fur- nishes a protected habitat for many obligate understory algae that die or defoliate after the removal of Hedophyllum. Hedophyllum loses this dominance in the most exposed areas, al- though such sites apparently represent its physiologically optimal habitat, because in these areas it is out-competed by Laminaria setchellii and Lessoniopsis littoralis. In these wave ex- posed habitats Lessoniopsis was demonstrated to exert a strong competitive dominance over all the other species in the association. The molluscan herbivores were not observed to express any measurable effects on the recruitment or survival of the algae. However, the echinoid Strongylocentrotus purpuratus often overexploits its prey and has a pronounced influence on most of the algal species. In this respect S. purpuratus enjoys an important community role singular among the many herbivores. Similarly, Pycnopodia helianthoides and Anthopleura xanthogrammica are dis- proportionately important carnivores, because their predation on Strongylocentrotus, clear- ing large areas of urchins, results in patches in which algal succession follows. The rate of algal succession following removal of the dominant algal species or of Strongy- locentrotus is proportional to the degree of wave exposure. The Hedophyllum canopy recovery at the Eagle Point area of San Juan Island, a site exposed to relatively little wave action and thus high levels of desiccation, was relatively slow, with only 1O{\%}-26{\%} cover reestablished after 3 yr. In contrast, Hedophyllum canopy developed up to 66{\%} cover in only 1 yr in the exposed area of Waadah Island; it then quickly lost its dominance to Laminaria and Lessoniop- sis. Algal succession in deeper Portage Head tidepools was found to be relatively slow with no clear dominance expressed after 5 yr.},

Environment/skipjack distribution relationships derived from this information are applied to long- term annual mean distributions of dissolved oxygen and thermal structure for the Atlantic Ocean between lat. 40"N and 40°S. The depth of skipjack habitat is mapped. Within the defined habitat areas, high vulnerability of skipjack tuna to surface gear is inferred and areally compared with the long-term catch of the FIS (French, Ivory Coast, and Senegalese) fleet to confirm the validity of this approach. This technique is then used to hypothesize areas of vulnerability of skipjack to surface gear outside the range of the FIS fleet effort in the western Atlantic. Finally, the effects of surface winds on fishing operations are discussed and those areas where wind speed may hamper operations are outlined for the Atlantic Ocean between lat. 30"N and 30"S.},

abstract = {Observations have been made on seasonal fluctuations in dissolved inorganic nutrients, internal reserves of nitrogen and growth rates in Laminaria longicruris. The onset of winter growth in shallow-water stations (6 and 9 m) correlated well with improved dissolved nitrate conditions in the sea. During the winter, reserves of NO3-were accumulated by the plants and reached maximum values of 150 µmoles per g fresh weight in March. This represents a concentration factor of approximately 28,000 over the ambient levels, or an internal nitrogen reserve of 2.1{\%} of the dry weight of the tissue. Depletion of this nitrogen pool followed the disappearance of the external NO3-with a lag period of up to 2 months. Rapid kelp growth was measured during this period. Reserves of organic nitrogen also reached maximum values in March and declined slowly throughout the summer into autumn. It is suggested that the combined inorganic and organic nitrogen reserves sustain the rapid growth rates into July and at reduced rate through the late summer. Fertilization of an experimental perimental kelp bed with NaNO3 increased the internal plant reserves of NO3-and produced a much improved summer growth rate. The enriched plants developed very small reserves of carbohydrate during the rapid summer growth phase.},

abstract = {Cool nutrient rich waters combined with a rocky coastline extending infratidally make the west coast of South Africa well suited to growth of kelp species. The kelp bed community is compared with the main kelp beds studied elsewhere (Nova Scotia, W. Europe, California). All these areas have cool, nutrient-rich water but the Benguela region differs in that large swells prevail. This paper deals with the determination of faunal and algal boundaries in these kelp beds (composed mainly ofEcklonia maxima andLaminaria pallida), as well as their biomass, in order to build a descriptive model of the food web. The main components of a site representative of the variable kelp beds on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula (Oudekraal) have been identified and quantified in terms of ash-free dry weight and Joules. The study covered an area from the rocky intertidal zone to the rock/sand interface found at a depth of 20 m. The site was divided into different areas (offshore, intermediate, inshore), and these were subdivided into depth zones of 4 m to show up any differences with depth. Different sampling techniques using SCUBA were combined to cover a wide range of organisms in the survey. Horizontal and vertical surfaces were differentiated. Kelp holdfasts were removed as a sampling unit for the infauna study. The distribution data of the organisms, other than kelp, were studied by means of multivariate methods which confirmed the division into inshore, mediate and offshore associations. Differences in faunal and floral composition could be detected between horizontal and vertical surfaces. Kelp biomass data showed high average standing crop in the inshore and mediate locality compared to the low offshore values. Maximum standing crop values, however, were not reduced. Mechanisms regulating the kelp bed structure are discussed. In the inshore and intermediate areas, algal biomass is much higher than animal biomass. A fact emerging from the data is that there is relatively little biomass of grazers; the major primary consumers are filter feeders. Problems of turnover rates are mentioned and an energy flow diagram for the area is proposed and its validity discussed.},

abstract = {Concentrations of nutrients in the vicinity of the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) off San Diego, California, varied seasonally. Surface nitrate concentrations were low for most of the year (usually {\textless}1 AM), higher during winter. Nitrate concentrations below 4.5-m depth usually exceeded 1 AM and were highest during spring upwelling, lowest during summer. Nutrients in the kelp bed were not depleted by the kelp nor enhanced by sedi- ment regeneration, implying relatively fast exchange between water in the bed and outside waters. Nutrient concentrations varied at different longshore locations. The condition most limiting to M. pyrifera was probably the low concentration of dissolved nutrients, espe- cially nitrogenous substances, near the sea surface. Translocation of nitrogenous com- pounds by the kelp plant from depths where concentrations are higher could compensate for this limitation. The summer die-off of the surface canopy may be caused by the in- ability of plants to translocate nutrients due to low availability of nutrients in the deeper water. The maximum change in dissolved oxygen measured was 0.43 mol 02 m2 between 0900 and 1130 PST; extrapolated to 1 day this yields a production of 1.0 mol 02 m2 d-' (9.5 g C m-2 d1).},

abstract = {A stable kelp bed ecosystem in St. Margaret's Bay, Nova Scotia (Canada), had as its main producers Laminaria longicruris and L. digita. Most algal production was ex- ported as detritus, but there was a moderate population of herbivores, mainly the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. These were eaten by crabs, Cancer irroratus and by lob- sters, Hornarus americanus. Lobsters also preyed on crabs. Beginning in 1968, sea urchins became locally abundant and overgrazed the kelp beds, converting large areas to urchin- dominated barren grounds. Almost all kelp beds in St. Margaret's Bay (140 km 2) have now been destroyed. During the same period, lobster biomass decreased, and the hypothesis was put forward that reduction in lobster predation led to increased urchin abundance and kelp bed destruction. Evidence is presented for the hypothesis that urchin-dominated barren grounds are a new, stable configuration of the ecosystem, and that a long-term decrease in primary and secondary productivity of these coastal waters can be expected.},

abstract = {The kelp-bed fish fauna off Santa Barbara is mainly warm-temperate, but includes abun- dances of some primarily cool-temperate species from the north. Using underwater movie strips (cinetransects), we sampled assemblages of this fauna, near the kelp canopy and just over the reef bottom, in nine localities along Santa Cruz Island and the adjacent mainland coast. Factor analysis of these samples indicated that the species are loosely organized into five "habitat groups," which are characteristic of (1) areas of high-relief rock and dense kelp, (2) the kelp canopy. (3) shallow areas at or beyond the margins of reefs and kelp beds, (4) the midwaters, from kelp canopy to bottom, and (5) areas of reef bottom and sparse kelp. Mean fish density, biomass, and diversity varied significantly among localities and between mainland and island, but not between winter-spring and summer-fall. Means increased with rocky relief and bottom depth, and were generally greatest for island localities. Relatively more habitat generalists from the marginal and midwater groups (e.g. surfperches) occurred in areas of mixed bottom types and turbid water. More reef specialists from the kelp-rock group, many of which require shelter holes at night, occurred in areas of extensive rocky bottom and clear water. Phylogenetically, these sheltering species have comparatively close tropical relatives (i.e. are "tropical derivatives"). The island assemblages contained greater abundances of tropical derivatives, which contributed to the higher fish density and diversity. This "island effect ' on species composition is probably caused by habitat differences rather than oceano- graphic differences or isolation between mainland and island. Island habitats, as well as island-like habitats along the mainland, have clearer water, more continuous high-relief rocky bottom, and perhaps more fish food. Thus, they may offer more opportunities for tropical derivatives to shelter at night and to partition the available space and food during the day},

abstract = {The manner in which terrestrial ecosystems are regulated is controversial. The "top-down" school holds that predators limit herbivores and thereby prevent them from overexploiting vegetation. "Bottom-up" proponents stress the role of plant chemical defenses in limiting plant depredation by herbivores. A set of predator-free islands created by a hydroelectric impoundment in Venezuela allows a test of these competing world views. Limited area restricts the fauna of small (0.25 to 0.9 hectare) islands to predators of invertebrates (birds, lizards, anurans, and spiders), seed predators (rodents), and herbivores (howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants). Predators of vertebrates are absent, and densities of rodents, howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants are 10 to 100 times greater than on the nearby mainland, suggesting that predators normally limit their populations. The densities of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees are severely reduced on herbivore-affected islands, providing evidence of a trophic cascade unleashed in the absence of top-down regulation.},

abstract = {The natural diet and mode of feeding of the rock lobster J. lalandii (H. Milne Edwards) was determined in a rock-lobster sanctuary near Cape Town, South Africa. Field observations were tested and confirmed by means of aquarium studies. Rock lobsters feed mainly upon ribbed mussels A. ater (Molina), which comprise the largest component of the sessile benthic fauna. Mussel remains were found as the major constituent in 97{\%} of the rock-lobster stomachs examined. The density of rock lobsters averaged 8100/ha (0.81 m-2), while mussel biomass averaged more than 5 kg (wet whole weight) m-2 within the same depth range (12-30 m). More than 80{\%} of the mussel biomass comprised large individuals between 60 and 90 mm in length. Large rock lobsters (mainly males) were capable of feeding on all sizes of mussels, although many of these were inaccessible to predation. Smaller rock lobsters became progressively more limited in the size range of mussels which they could crack open and consume. Competition between rock lobsters for small mussels appeared to be intense, as mussels of suitable size for feeding were generally in short supply to most of the rock-lobster population. Feeding and growth rates of rock lobsters are likely to be affected by the relative population densities of predator and prey. Growth rates of rock lobsters could be limited by food supplies even in areas where mussel biomass is comparatively large.},

The need for this investigation was felt in view of the importance of kelp beds to the near-shore ecosystem and reports describing the extent of damage to some Californian and eastern Canadian kelp beds by the grazing activity of certain urchin species. Experimental sites typical of the area were permanently marked. A study site was protected from urchins, while the control was not. Urchins were regularly removed from the study site. Kelps growing on the experimental plots were harvested seasonally, counted and their biomass calculated. Results over one year suggest that although the grazing potential of sea urchins is considerable, little impact was made on kelp beds in the study area. The grazing potential of Parechinus seems to be directed principally at the early sporophytes of Ecklonia maxima rather than at adult plans.},

abstract = {The cover of foliose algae is sparse to non-existent above a low-level algal zone on many shores in N.S.W., except in rock-pools. Above this algal zone, encrusting algae, mostly Hildenbrandia prototypus, occupy most of the primary substratum on sheltered shores. Experimental manipulations at midtidal levels were used to test hypotheses about the effects of grazing by molluses and of physical factors during low tide on this pattern of algal community structure. Fences and cages were used to exclude grazers: molluscs grazed under roofs and in open areas. Cages and roofs provided shade, and decreased the harshness of the environment during low tide: fences and open areas had the normal environmental regime. In the absence of grazers, rapid colonization of Ulva and slower colonization by other foliose algae occurred in all experimental areas. The rate of colonization by Ulva sporelings was initially retarded on existing encrusting algae, but after a few months, cover of Ulva equalled that on cleared rock. Most species of algae only grew to maturity inside cages, and remained as a turf of sporelings inside fences. No foliose algae grew to a visible size in open, grazed areas. Grazing thus prevents the establishment of foliose algae above their normal upper limit on the shore, but the effects of physical factors during low tide prevent the growth of algae which become established when grazers are removed. Physical factors thus limit the abundance of foliose algae at mid-tidal levels. The recolonization of cleared areas by Hildenbrandia was not affected by the presence of a turf of sporelings, nor by the shade cast by roofs, but was retarded in cages where mature algae formed a canopy. Even under such a canopy, Hildenbrandia eventually covered as much primary substratum as in open, grazed areas. This encrusting alga is able to escape from the effects of grazing by having a tough thallus, and by its vegetative growth which allows individual plants to cover a lot of substratum, and by the tendency for new individuals to start growing from small cracks and pits in the rock, which are apparently inaccessible to the grazers. Mature foliose algae are removed from the substratum by waves, and many individual plants died during periods of hot weather. Sporelings in a turf were eliminated, after experimental fences were removed, by the combined effects of macroalgal grazers, which invaded the areas, and microalgal grarers which ate the turt from the edges inwards. The results obtained here are discussed with respect to other studies on limits to distribution of intertidal macroalgae, and the role of grazing in the diversity and structure of intertidal algal communities. Some problems of these experimental treatments are also discussed.},

These nutrients may then cause blooms of surf zone phytoplankton which in turn serve as food for macrofauna filter feeders.

Experimental removal of urchins leads to the development, within 1 yr, of a kelp association of high biomass and diversity. In the 2nd yr, however, these attributes decrease as a single kelp species, Laminaria groenlandica, becomes dominant. Additional field experiments confirm the competitive superiority of this kelp. These manipulations lead to predictions regarding the ecological role of sea otters, a once common (but now absent) sea urchin predator. The predictions are tested and verified by examining areas into which sea otters have recently been transplanted. As expected, a rapid and extensive modification of algal species composition and a dramatic increase in kelp biomass follow the return of sea otters.},

abstract = {A synthetic "functional form" paradigm concerning hypothetically important adaptive features of algal structure and function was developed and tested by a costs/benefits strategic approach. Successional manipulations were performed by disturbing mature, environmentally constant intertidal communities; from the array of colonizing macroalgae, Ulva sp. was chosen as an opportunistic representative of pioneer seral stages, Egregia menziesii and Gelidium purpurascens/robustum as intermediate to late seral species, and Pelvetia fastigiata and Corallina officinalis as characteristic of more mature climax communities. The ranking from high to low primary producers (Ulva {\textgreater} Gelidium {\textgreater} Egregia {\textgreater} Pelvetia {\textgreater} Corallina) indicates that selection in fluctuating environments has favored opportunistic species having high net productivity, while those species able to persist in benign predictable habitats do so at the cost of lower photosynthetic rates and presumably slower growth. The kilocalories per ash-free gram dry weight from highest to lowest species were Ulva (5.44), Gelidium (4.62), Pelvetia (4.17), Egregia (4.10), and Corallina (3.86). With the exception of Pelvetia, which occurs high in the intertidal, these calorific values suggest that selection has tended to reduce nutritive content in climax algal forms. The results for percent thallus loss to urchin grazing over a 48 h period generally support the hypothesis that selection has differentially favored the evolution of antipredator defenses in environmentally constant macrophyte communities; Ulva lost considerably more of its blotted wet weight (43.1{\%}) compared to Pelvetia (36.2{\%}), Gelidium (22.9{\%}), Egregia (22.6{\%}), and the late seral form Corallina (19.6{\%}). Ulva contained the lowest percentage of nonpigmented (structural) components (0.6{\%}), followed by Gelidium (46.2{\%}), Pelvetia (57.3{\%}), Corallina (81.7{\%} CaCO3), and Egregia 82.9{\%}) which indicates that selection in mature communities has tended to increase allocation of materials to nonpigmented supportive structure at the expense of photosynthetic tissue. Later successional macroalgae showed greater toughness as well as greater resistance to wave-shearing forces than the opportunistic species, thus implicating selection for persistence as opposed to rapid growth in climax communities. Data on succession, productivity, and toughness indicate that E. menziesii shifts from an opportunistic strategy during its juvenile stages to a highly differentiated complex form able to persist in mature successional stages. The co-occurrence of different morphological phases of the same species (e.g., Scytosiphon lomentaria, hollow sheet; Petalonia fascia, sheet; and their Ralfsia-like forms, crusts), along with information contrasting productivity, palatability, and longevity between Gigartina papillata and its crustose alternate Petrocelis middendorffii, suggests that some algae have the capacity to concurrently adopt strategies of both opportunistic and climax algal forms.},

Currents, measured by SCUBA divers at five stations around the study site reached 40 cm s-1 at the surface, but were slower and more variable in mid-water (4-11 m) and just above the bottom (8-22 m). Surface currents correlated with wind, but not tide, offshore winds causing offshore surface drift and onshore currents below, while onshore winds reversed these flow patterns. Water transport budgets indicate that the volume of water at the study site (3??75??106m3) turned over between three and seven times per day during upwelling. Nutrients (NO3, P and Si) peaked during active upwelling, when temperatures fell below 12 ??C, and were minimal under downwelling conditions, NO3 failling to 1 ??g at l-1.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The microbial community which colonises particulate debris from the kelp Laminaria pallida shows a succession from bacteria, through flagellates, ciliates, amoebae and choanoflagellates over a period of up to 34 d incubation at 10 "C. The biomass of bacteria reaches only 16.5 mg g-' of added organic matter compared with 42 mg g-' dry weight of dissolved organic matter added from kelp mucilage, despite the fact that the combined biomass of grazing protozoans in both cases was 4.2-4.6 mg g-' of added organic matter. This suggests that the dissolved components of mucilage, comprising principally the acyclic polyol D-mannitol and other carbohydrates, are more readily utilisable as a substrate than the particulate components of kelp debris. The carbon in particulate debris is converted into bacterial biomass with an efficiency of approximately 11 {\%} compared with values of up to 29 {\%} which have been reported for mucilage incubated wlth seawater during the summer Differences in conversion efficiency of soluble compounds and particulate debris from L. pallida are also reflected in the time taken for utilisation by microheterotrophs under culture conditions. The time taken for 50 {\%} utilisation of particulate debris at 10 "C was 240 h compared with reported values of 144 h for sugars and alginates and only 48 h for mannitol incubated at 10 'C. Estimates of the relative significance of dissolved and particulate components released during fragmentation of kelp suggest that out of an annual average carbon production of 820.5 X 104 kg from a kelp bed of 700ha. a dry bacterial biomass of 72.20 X 104 kg is supported by particulate production and 29.9 X 104 kg from mucilage, yielding a total bacterial biomass of 102.10 X 104 kg.

This area as mapped in detail by means of underwater photography and in situ drawings, in order to provide an objective standard. It is concluded that point-intercept methods, whether linear (POLI) or planar (POSU), should be discarded. A random-point method, the point-centered quarter method (POCQ) scores only moderately as well as the line transect (LITR), so far the most popular method in reef surveys. The three remaining methods perform quite well for estimating the dominant species. The first one consists of in situ drawn maps of quadrats (ISM). The second one is a photographic record of reef sections (PHRC); although giving good results, it is considered unpractical because of the equipment and the facilities involved, and the amount of time needed to work out field data.},

At the lowest sea urchin biomass and density encountered re-establishment of mature kelp stands seems highly unlikely. The sea urchin population required to suppress kelp regeneration is fed by benthic microalgae. Diatoms and other pioneer algal community species were found in the guts of sea urchins. The mean standing crop of benthic microalgae was found to be, 2.2 g C m-2 and production estimated as ca 15 g C m-2yr-1 at 8m depth.

The growth of individually tagged sea urchins in the populations was recorded at monthly intervals to determine seasonal growth patterns. Ages were determined by counting annually formed rings in their genital plates. The effect of tagging on annual growth rates of sea urchins was determined by comparing the sizes of tagged and untagged individuals of the same ages at the end of the study. Growth of tagged individuals was seasonal and their annual growth rates decreased with increasing size. Monthly growth rates of the tagged sea urchins were lowest in winter, highest in early spring, and declined sharply during late spring and early summer. Tagging did not significantly affect the growth of tagged compared to untagged individuals during the study. Regression of the sizes of tagged sea urchins after 1 year on their initial size suggested that the growth of this species does not conform well to commonly used growth models such as the von Bertalanffy equation.},

We investigated 2 hypotheses: 1) that this important herbivore would feed selectively on these algae and 2) that Desmarestza firma, one of these algae, would be unattractive to Parechinus on account of the H2S04 in the thallus. Algal preferences are determined from 3 types of feeding experiment, results of which support our first hypothesis, and allow us to group the algae into 3 arbitrary categories: “preferred”, “intermediate”, and “non-preferred”. To explain these patterns, we measured “relative astringen- cy” of each species (essentially a phenol measurement), and phenol content of 4 species (FOLIN- DENIS method). Rates of feeding on single species are negatively correlated with relative astringen- cies (r = 0.76, P = 0.99). The high relative astringency of D.firma is caused by its high (18 {\%} per dry mass) H,SO, content, and it is non-preferred. Our results therefore support our second hypothesis. Other implications of these results are discussed.},

Laboratory results indicated that uptake was saturated at a flow rate equivalent to 2.5 cm s -1 current velocity. Flow rates over intact blades in situ always exceeded this uptake saturation level. Wave surge and movement of plant surfaces relative to the surrounding water provided suffi- cient flow to saturate uptake, even in a dense kelp canopy during low-current and calm sea-state conditions.

Initial colonisation by cocci to lysis and release of cell contents. Lysed cells are then colonised by bacterial rods. High concentrations of leachates, reaching 5,640 mg carbon1 super(-1) subsequently appear beneath the decomposing kelp. Over 90{\%} of the carbon in these leachates is utilised by bacteria during drainage through a strip of sand 1 m long, 50 cm wide and 12 cm deep, although on an open beach other organisms, e. g. nematodes, may be capable of direct absorption of such organic matter. Calculation of carbon flow via grazing invertebrates and through bacteria shows that 23-27{\%} of the carbon in kelp is converted to bacterial carbon. Estimates of the bacterial carbon in equilibrium with the kelp cast up on the strandline suggest that 1648 g of kelp carbon is deposited per metre of strandline each 8 d.},
annote = {{\textgreater} This paper summarises the results of studies made on the realtive rate of utilisation of kelp by the dominant consumers and by microheterotrophic decomposer organisms. The results allowed us to make some quantitative estimates of the relative significance of consumer organisms and microheterotrophic pathways in the energetics of the sandy beach community. Stydy site was located at Kommetjie. Sampling included invertebrate consumer species, microbial communities and biochemical components. 

{\textgreater} The results presented in this study suggest that bacteria are primarily responsible for the decomposistion and subsequent utilisation of kelp debris on the strandline, rather than fungi as generlly reported. Succession of microbial communities was also clear. 

{\textgreater} Lysis of the cells, most likely through bacterial decomposition, results in the release of high concentrations of dissolved organic matter as leachates immediatey below decomposing kelp. Values as high as 5640 mg carbon l(-1) was recorded. The high concentrations of such compounds may result in the direct absorption by eiofauna which occurs under natural conditions in more mature sand columns on sandy open beaches. 

{\textgreater} In the microcosom study, it was found that of 100 grams carbon in kelp 8.9{\%} was consumed by invertebrates. 
{\textgreater}Grazers consumed {\~{}}6.9{\%} of orginal kelp carbon
{\textgreater} Broader study showed that 74{\%} of bech-cast kelp is consumed by the amphipod Talorchestia capensis and the diperan larvae Fucellia capensis, and the dipteran larva of Fucellia capensis.

{\textgreater} Carbon flow analyses of both decomposer and consumer dominated systems suggest that some 23 -27{\%} of the carbon from kelp is assimilated into large standing stock of bacterial carbon in the intertidal zone whilst the residual 73 to 77{\%} of the carbon from kelp is rapidly mineralised by the sand beach bacteria within {\~{}}8 days. This microbrial action is similar to what has been reported for water comlumns and therefore microbial communities play a central role in the rapid regeneration of inorganic materials needed to support the high primary production of a kelp bed.

The kelp debris, which forms an important component of the particulate matter potentially available for consumers, may thus represent an important source of carbon for the filter feeding community adjacent to kelp beds.

Agassiz) and S. purpuratus (Stimpson), which are major herbivores in southern California kelp forest communities. Aquarium experiments indicate that spiny lobsters strongly prefer S. purpuratus over S. franciscanus of comparable test diameter, probably accounting for the higher number of S. purpuratus mortalities observed in the field. Juvenile S. franciscanus ({\textless} 60 mm test diameter, TD) are preferred over larger conspecifics, but the smallest S. franciscanus ({\textless} 30 mm TD) are protected by association with the adult urchin spine canopy. Mid-sized S. franciscanus too large to fit under the spine canopy are subject to intense predation. All sizes of P. interruptus tested showed a notable reluctance to attack large S. franciscanus ({\textgreater} 90 mm TD) when offered a range of sizes, although the larger lobsters are capable of handling the largest urchins. Relative movement, spine length, test thickness, and gonad weights of sea urchins were examined to evaluate the factors affecting the lobsters' choice of prey, and behavioral responses to lobsters were assessed to determine urchin availability to these predators. The handling problems associated with the long spines of larger S. franciscanus appear to be the major considerations in prey choice despite the much greater potential energy gain from these urchins. Thus predation by spiny lobsters appears to be sufficient to explain the bimodal size-frequency distribution typical of S. franciscanus populations in areas where these predators are common. Heavy fishing pressure on spiny lobsters during this century probably resulted in the release of sea urchin populations and contributed to episodes of destructive urchin grazing observed in the 1950's and subsequent years. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {Factors influencing the early colonization by benthic macroalgae and the early successional sequence in a subtidal Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh forest in Port Jackson (Sydney) were investigated using controlled experiments involving the microscopic sampling of settlement plates. The preliminary results indicate that the Tolerance model of succession may be applicable. The effect of grazers, and competition between different algal types were important and could, later in the succession, lead to the operation of the mechanisms suggested by the Facilitation or Inhibition models. Controls for the use of settlement plates showed that thick settlement plates led to an over-estimation of initial algal growth compared with the growth on natural patches of substratum. Other results suggested that thick plates excluded grazers. Borders of plates were investigated, but the establishment of algae was random over the plates′ surfaces and border effects were the result of physical or biotic factors acting on algae after settlement. An experiment was developed for use in subtidal areas to test for artifacts due to cages. It was found that the presence of the cages influences the community by attracting small snails. Fish were excluded from some areas to monitor their effects on initial algal growth. Exclusion of fish was found to cause a reduction in algal growth as well as increases in numbers of small invertebrates such as amphipods and copepods. The results suggested that the amount of algae initially present was affected by invertebrate grazers, the abundances of which were, in turn, affected by predation. The species diversity of the early algal growth did not show any consistent trends between high and low grazing pressure. Grazing was important in determining the temporal variability of early growth of individual species. Siltation was positively correlated with early algal growth; a mechanism to account for this effect is suggested. The application of the methods used in this study to future experimental studies of sublittoral community dynamics is considered.},

abstract = {One of the most distinctive and frequently cited features of exposed sandy beaches as ecosystems is their almost complete lack of in situ primary production (e.g. Brown, 1964; Munro et al., 1978; McLachlan et al., 1981a). This results directly from the mobility of the sediments, which renders them unsuitable for the attachment of macrophytes or the development of dense benthic diatom communities. In the absence of these potential food resources macrofaunal organisms on exposed beaches must obtain their nutrition from imported materials. These may take the form of finely divided detritus or phytoplankton particles, many of which may originate from rich blooms of phytoplankton in the surf zone (McLachlan et al., 1981b), or large items of carrion. The macro-fauna associated with these food resources normally comprises two major trophic elements, namely filter feeders, including bivalves (such as Donax) and crustacea (such as Emenita and Gastnosaccub); and predator/scavengers (e.g. Bullia, Ocypode,various isopods and polychaetes). The proportion of these two trophic elements differs widely, depending on the relative availability of plankton and detritus versus carrion (McLachlan et al., 1981a), but filter feeding bivalves are frequently the overwhelming dominants in terms of biomass (e.g. McLachlan et al., 1981b).},

In previous work, Greenwood (1947) found that urchins below 10mm exhibited a slower growth rate than larger counter parts

In previous work, Buxton (1977) showed that smaller urchins fed primarily on detritus, rather than living kelp. However, results were difficult to quantify.

"Considerable variation in the amount of food ingested by urchins has been shown and may be affected by temperature, season, animal size and the physiological state of the animal (Lawrence 1975)."

Based on productivity estimates by Field et al (1979), the authors calculate that the sea urchins at Oudekraal consume approximately 14{\%} of annual kelp production. These findings are comparable with work by Fricke (1979) who estimated that urchins consume 20{\%} of annual kelp production in False Bay.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Measurements of attachment strength of the mussels Mytilus californianus and Mytilus edulis were related to measurements of drag on mussels with algal epizoans in order to understand the ecological mechanics of mussel dislodgement. Attachment strength increased with shell area, and was influenced by the location of the mussel within the aggregation, and by the exposure of the habitat. M. caljfornianus had a stronger attachment than M. edulis. In both species, significantly greater force was required to dislodge mussels at the edge of the mussel bed than at the center. The mean attachment strength of M. edulis was 15 times greater in exposed habitats than in protected habitats. In the lab and field, mussels overgrown by kelp encountered flow-induced forces that were 2 to 6 times greater than flow forces on the mussels alone. Flow-induced forces ranged from 0.12 to 1.08 Newtons, and increased with velocity from 12 to 62 cm S-'. There was no significant relation between surface area of attached kelp and drag. Flow force data and surveys of dislodged mussels at an exposed beach indicate that epizoans increase the risk of mussel dislodgement, which has {\~{}}mportant implications for intertidal mussel beds impacted by disturbance events.},

Tegula rnontere{\~{}},i occurs at intermediate and deep depths but is relatively rare. I examined the effects of larval recruitment. interspecific competition. and benthic predation on the maintenance of these patterns. The distribution of recently settled juvenile snails coincides closely with adult distributions. in- dicat{\~{}}ng that planktonic larvae of the three species ma1 settle differential11 to different depths. Juveniles of the two abundant species occur in different microhabitats at the extremes of their adult ranges: juvenile Tegula brunrzea occur in the low-intertidal'shallow-subtidal zone on algae-covered rock substrate. and juvenile T. pullrgo occur in deep water (I 1-1 2 m) on shell-fragment rubble. T. rnontereyi juveniles are less abundant than those of the other two species: depth and microhabitat distributions are similar to those of T. pullrgo. Competition among the three species is not strong: neither food nor space limitation appears to occur in nature. The effects of competition on patterns of movement and habitat use in the field and on growth and reproductive development in the laboratory showed that interspecific and intraspecific effects were not significantly different. In addition. densities at which competition would have a strong effect are probabl{\~{}} much higher than those that occur naturall{\~{}}. It is unlikely that competition is responsible for the bathymetric segregation of the three species. The major predators of Tegula are benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes. Tegula have two spatial refuges from predators: kelp plants (which allow snails to stay off the primary substratum and away from predators) and dense benthic vegetation (predators cannot detect and capture snails as easily in areas of dense vegetation). Benthic predation pressure increases with increasing substrate depth because (I) the cover of protective benthic vegetation decreases significantly. and (2)predators are more abundant in deeper water. Higher predation pressure in deeper water limits adult Tegula hrunnea to shallower depths. In- dividual T. bruunea spend more time on the kelp forest floor than do individuals of the other two species. causing them to be killed at a disproportionate11 higher rate in deeper water. Benthic predation is also responsible for the concentration of T. pulligo on kelp plants in deeper depths. but cannot explain why this species is not more abundant in shallow depths. The rarity of T. rpzontereyr is not caused by predation. since this species is the best defended of the three against starfish. For both species. patterns and intensities of larval settlement may be of primary importance. Further information on the larval biology of these species is needed.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the genetic structures of 22 species of salamanders, with regard to levels of gene flow among populations. We estimate the gene flow parameter, Nm (the product of the effective population number and rate of migration among populations) using two alternative methods described by Wright and Slatkin. For most species, these two methods give approximately congruent estimates of Nm; when estimates differ, the method of Wright produces values slightly larger than those derived by the method of Slatkin. We analyze these results in light of independently derived historical inferences of the fragmentation of populations. This analysis suggests that the Nm values calculated from protein polymorphisms may contain information more relevant to historical patterns of gene exchange than to the current population dynamics; moderately large values of Nm may be calculated for species containing populations known to be no longer exchanging genes. Application of a method for estimating the maximum possible rate of gene exchange among populations indicates that, for most species studied here, gene flow among populations probably is no greater than the mutation rate. We suggest that most plethodontid species cannot be viewed as units whose cohesion is maintained by continuing gene exchange. Furthermore, we suggest that phenotypic uniformity among populations is not easily explained by hypotheses of continual stabilizing selection and propose that future work concentrate upon clarification of the genetic and epigenetic factors conferring self-maintenance or autopoietic properties on living systems.},

Maximum values of invertebrate density and biomass occur in late winter and spring, while higher values of species richness and diversity (H') are found in winter. Quantitative data indicate that 4 species (Pseudechinus magellanicus, Pagurus forceps, Halicarcinus planatus, Anasterias antarctica) are the determinant taxa in the overall changes of invertebrate biomass and density. Data on body size and average weight of these species indicate that neither growth nor juvenile recruitment are responsible for the overall pattern of change. Migration behavior of these species is a more likely explanation. The rate of accumulation of species of invertebrates to the holdfast is fast in small holdfasts, very slow in larger holdfasts, and the pioneer species are also found in larger and older holdfasts. Thus, the dynamic of species turn over does not follow a species replacement series typical of colonization processes described for non-growing habitats. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Introduction We studied the effects of grazing by two species of sea urchins on two species of kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora caIifornica) in the San Onofre kelp bed in southern California from 1978 through 1981. Both red sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus franciseanus, and white sea urchins, Lytechinus anarnesus, were abundant and lived in aggregations. The purple sea urchin (S. purpuratus) was rare at the study site and was not studied. The aggrega-tions of red urchins were either relatively small and stationary (for over 3 yr) or relatively large and motile (advancing at about 2 m mo-1). Both stationary and moving aggregations were observed at the same time, and within 100 m of one another. Stationary aggregations of red urchins probably subsisted mainly on drift kelp and had no effect on kelp recruitment or on adult kelp abun-dance. In contrast, red sea urchins in large, motile ag-gregations or "fronts" ate almost all the macroalgae in their path. The condition of their gonads indicated that red urchins in fronts were starved relative to red urchins in the small, stationary aggregations. Large, motile aggrega-tions developed after 2 yr of declining kelp abundance (probably due largely to storms). We propose that a scarcity of drift algae for food results in a change in the behavior pattern of the red urchins and thus leads to the formation of large, motile aggregations. The aggregations of white urchins, which occurred along the offshore mar-gin of the kelp bed, were large, but relatively stationary. The white urchins rarely ate adult kelps, but grazed ex-tensively on early developmental stages of kelps and evidently prevented seaward expansion of the bed. The spatial distribution of both types of red urchin aggrega-tions appeared to be unrelated to predation pressure from fishes or lobsters.},

The long term, or seasonal, component was consistent with large-scale storm-induced mixing and horizontal advection during winter months. In addition, vertical motions of the thermocline, bringing nutrients into the kelp forest, occurred throughout the year with a frequency of about 2 per day and were strongest during the summer months. High frequency sampling was required to resolve the pattern of nutrient input accurately. The major component of nutrient input came during the winter.

abstract = {The subtidal (10-1 5 m) assemblage in the relatively sheltered giant kelp forest at Still- water Cove in Carmel Bay, California, consists of perennial species forming three major vertical layers: a .liiacrocystis pyrifera surface canopy, a dense subsurface canopy of another kelp, Pterygophora californica, and an understory of articulated and encrusting coralline algae. The kelp canopies alone or in combination can reduce bottom light to 13{\%} (usually {\textless}1{\%}) of surface influx. The effects of light reduction by these vegetation layers on algal recruitment and subsequent growth were determined by removing various combinations of canopies over a 2-yr period, and following subsequent changes relative to appropriate controls. Removing both M. pyrifera and P. californica canopies resulted in moderate recruitment of these species as well as of the annual brown alga Desmarestia ligulata var. ligulata. None of these algae recruited into control areas where one or both canopies were left intact. Highest brown and red algal recruitment occurred when both kelp canopies plus understory coralline branches were removed. Removal of the latter alone had no significant effect. The time of year when algal canopies were removed had little effect on the composition of subsequent algal colonization, as the recruitment of noncalcareous species occurred primarily during a short period in the spring. These results indicate that the relatively low levels of both physical and biological disturbance in Stillwater Cove allow the establishment of a few perennial algal species that inhibit their own recruitment, as well as invasion of other species, by shading. This contrasts with nearby kelp forests subjected to greater and more frequent disturbance, and characterized by a diverse assemblage of annual algal species. Key},

abstract = {This paper considers three concepts of stability as they relate to the dynamics of dis- tinctive patch types of algal canopy guilds in southern and central California kelp communities: (1) persistence of a patch through more than one generation of the dominant species, which was evaluated by using life tables and observations of patch borders; (2) inertia or the resistance of different patches to invasion or disturbance, which was evaluated by artificially enhancing gametophytes by transplanting sporogenic material, by removing canopy, and by evaluating some important disturbance processes; and (3) resilience or recoverability of a patch following a perturbation sufficient to allow invasion of different species, which was studied by defining some of the mechanisms of successful invasion or succession. By working in distinct habitats in southern (Pt. Loma and Santa Catalina Island) and central (Pt. Piedras Blancas) California, we could evaluate different types of physical stresses as they related to these stability concepts. Taller perennial canopy guilds were dominant competitors for light, but were more susceptible to physical wave stress. Dominance hierarchies in the competition for light appeared to be reversed in areas exposed to increasing wave stress. The main causes of mortality at Pt. Loma were entanglement with storm-dislodged Macrocystis plants and, in some areas, sea urchin grazing. Mortality in central California was due to winter storms. In most cases, distinct patches resisted invasion for {\textgreater} 10 yr. The mechanisms of resistance involved (1) competition for light and, possibly, nutrients, and (2) limits to spore dispersal. When succession occurred, it was often mediated by many factors, including seasonality of spore production, which coincided with winter storm-related mortalities; mechanisms of kelp dispersal, which were most effective via drifting plants and fragments of fertile material held against the substrate by invertebrates; and survivorship of gametophytes and small sporophytes, which was influenced by local scour and grazing. Appropriate spatial scales, stability, and succession studies in these kelp communities were determined by the size of the disturbed area, which varied from the free space resulting from detachment of single plants to the free space resulting from catastrophies such as overgrazing or unusual storms. Temporal scales were influenced by seasonality of disturbance and algal reproductive condition and aperiodic episodes of cool, nutrient-rich water advected into the patch. There appeared to be conflicting morphological adaptations of the canopy guilds: exploitation of light was enhanced at higher canopy levels, whereas the lower canopy levels were better adapted to tolerate stress from wave surge. The adaptations of the algae appeared to form four distinct groups of tactics: (1) ruderals or plants, such as Nereocystis and Desmarestia, with opportunistic life histories; (2) kelps, such as Macrocystis, adapted to exploitative competition for light and nutrients; (3) kelps (Eisenia, Dictyoneurum) adapted to physical stress such as wave surge; and (4) those algae, such as corallines and Agarum, adapted to heavy grazing. Within any given area, the relative patch stability was determined by biological relationships; between areas, the patch stability patterns were attributable to physical differences.},

abstract = {The morphological and reproductive development of gametophytes of Ecklonia maxima (Osbeck) Papenf. has been studied in vitro under a wide range of light and temperature conditions, and the results related to the natural environment over the range of the distribution of the species. Initial vegetative growth was light saturated at 20 E m-2 s-1, and maximal at 17.5° and 20°C. Most rapid egg production corresponded to low cell number of female gametophytes, and this process was light saturated at 60 E m-2 s-1, and optimised at 15° and 17.5°C. Cell number was also low at lower temperatures, with reduced fertility rates. Sub-saturating irradiances and supraoptimal temperatures caused females to become filamentous, producing many more cells, and reducing reproductive rates. The final egg production per female was, however, greater in these sub-optimal conditions, and this phenomenon is interpreted as an ecological adaptation which improves survival prospects in conditions prevailing at the fringes of the depth and geographical distribution of the species. The optimal, and maximum (22.5°C) temperatures for reproduction are far higher than those of northern hemisphere Laminarians. E. maxima is very much a warm temperate organism, and this could have implications for marine phytogeographical studies on the west coast of southern Africa.},

Night diving observations showed that fishes were attacked by swarms of crustacean zooplankton, primarily the luminescent ostracod Vargula tsujii Kornicker {\&} Baker 1977 (Myodocopida: Cypridinidae) and the isopod Cirolana diminuta Menzies 1962 (Cirolanidae), species previously identified as members of the southern California demersal zooplankton assemblage. Both ostracods and isopods often invaded the gills, and also often entered the body cavity through the anus, consuming gonads and liver. Laboratory maze experiments showed that ostracods are attracted to chemicals released from sexually mature fishes and by their own bioluminescence. Isopods are attracted to chemicals released by injured fishes, thus they may preferentially attack fishes initially injured by ostracods. Emergent crustacean zooplankton may significantly influence nocturnal versus diurnal distributions and behavior of nearshore fishes. Surveys of commercial fisherman indicated that crustacean zooplankton also cause extensive damage to fishes caught in gill nets, often rendereing a significant percentage of a catch unmarketable.

abstract = {Regular observations made over a period of 5 yr in four permanent transects provided data on plant, sea urchin, and fish densities which indicate that two unusually severe winter storms in t980 ("Storm I") and 1983 ("Storm It") had different effects on a southern California kelp-forest community. Storm I removed all canopies of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, but spared most understory kelps, mainly Pterygophora californica. Hence, the previously large accumulation of detached drift kelp, mostly M. pyrifera, disappeared. Denied their preferred diet of drift kelp, the sea urchins Strongylocentrotusfranciscanus and S.purpuratus then emerged from shelters to find alternative food. Without effective predators, they con- sumed most living plants, including the surviving under- story kelps. This weakened the important detritus-based food chain, as indicated indirectly by declining abundances of algal turf and fish (Embiotocidae) that eat small animals living in turf. In 1983, Storm II reversed the process by eliminating exposed urchins, while clearing rock surfaces for widespread kelp settlement and growth. By summer 1984, the kelp grew to maturity to form extensive canopies despite elevated water temperatures during summer and fall of 1983. Thus, severe storms may have vastly different effects on community structure, depending on the state of the community before the disturbance. Introduction},

abstract = {The shallow subtidal rocky habitats in most temperate coastal areas are con- spicuously dominated by large brown algae in the orders Laminariales and Fucales. These algae are commonly referred to as kelps, although the term technically refers to Laminariales only. Their high productivity and com- plicated biological structure make kelps especially important members of their communities. For this reason, these communities havc received a great deal of research, including one of the first scientific applications of diving (128). This review summarizes the status of research programs operating within very different scales and emphasizes the point that a real understanding of the processes under study must come from the proper perspective and integration of the other levels. A taxonomic account of the world's kelps is far too complex for the scope of this review, but Mann (146) has characterized the world's kelp forests by their dominant genera. Laminaria species are found in many parts of the world but dominate both sides of the Atlantic and the coasts of China and Japan. Ecklonia dominates some kelp forests in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and a few other southern hemisphere localities. The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, forms dense tbrests in many parts of the world including areas of the northeast Pacific, the southern shores of South America, many Southern Ocean islands, and isolated areas of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Macrocystis pyriJora does not occur in the eastern Pacific area north of San Francisco, California; however, this northern region has the highest species diversity of kelps in the world (63), with Macrocystis integrifolia and Nereocystis, Alaria, Pterygophora, and Laminaria, among other conspicuous genera. *The US Government has the right to retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license in and to any copyright covering this paper. 215 Annual Reviews www.annualreviews.org/aronline 216 DAYTON Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1985.16:215-245. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org by University of California - Santa Cruz on 07/03/06. For personal use only. The life cycle of all kelps consists of an alternation of generations between microscopic haploid gametophytes and large diploid sporophytes which pro- dhce reproductive sori, often on specialized sporophylls. Reduction division occurs in the sporangium, producing microscopic zoospores which are released to settle on the bottom and develop into male and female gametophytes. Gametophytes produce antheridia and oogonia; fertilization results in zygote formation and the growth of sporophytes. Most ecological studies have focused on the large sporophyte stage; however, recent work emphasizes the different threshold factors important to the separate life-history stages, especially the gametophytes and juvenile stages (50, 205). This review is possible because the huge and often rather diffuse literature has received excellent reviews (21, 80, 119, 146, 158, 183, 205). ! will emphasize the kelp community models being developed in the northeastern Pacific because of my own familiarity with the system.

abstract = {A feeding planktonic larval stage may be viewed as a migration into the plankton during early development for feeding and safety. In this view, the extensive dispersal is an accidental by-product that increases gene flow and geographic range and hence affects speciation, extinction, and degree of adaptation to local conditions. Though the dispersal has profound evolutionary consequences, it does not appear to be selection for dispersal that maintains a feeding larval stage in life histories. The trades between investment per offspring, rate of growth, and risk are constrained by the capabilities of very conservative larval forms, and these trades are differently constrained among higher taxa. Most feeding larval forms are extremely ancient and conservative. Moreover, loss of a feeding larval stage is an absorbing state for most taxa. Life-history theories for marine animals cannot ignore a strong historical component stretching back to the origin of metazoa.},

At night, Arbacia i attraction for Gradaria increases significantly and its attraction toward Sargassum declines significantly.

abstract = {The concentrations of lipids were determined in atmospheric particle, gas and rain samples collected from the tropical North Pacific to assess lipid sources, transport mechanisms and fluxes to the ocean surface. Four lipid compound classes (aliphatic hydrocarbons, fatty alcohols, fatty acid esters, and salts) all unequivocally show a terrestrial vascular plant source. These aerosol lipids originate from wind erosion of Asian and American soils and direct emission from vegetation. The major fluxes result from rain rather than dry deposition. These fluxes are large enough to have a major potential impact on the inventory of terrestrially derived lipid material found in deep-sea sediments. This has been showm for n-alkanes, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, total lipids and for organic carbon. By comparing atmospheric and sediment trap fluxes with sediment accumulation rates, it is suggested that some biogenic terrestrial material is more protected from degradation than marine-derived material. {\textcopyright} 1986 Pergamon Journals Ltd.},

abstract = {Following mass mortalities of sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (M??ller), in the rocky subtidal of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, dense seaweed beds dominated by the canopy-forming kelp Laminaria longicruris de la Pylaie developed for the first time in several years. The numerically abundant grazers in the seaweed beds when sea urchins were rare were the mesogastropod Lacuna vincta (Montagu), the limpet Notoacmaea testudinalis (M??ller), and the chiton Tonicella rubra (Linn??). The limpet and chiton are unable to graze the macroscopic sporophytes of Laminaria, and a manipulation experiment showed that they have no significant effect on the recruitment of this kelp. In contrast, Lacuna grazes the macroscopic sporophyte and several of its population characteristics suggested that it might be a potentially important grazer of Laminaria. Snails can occur in high densities and several invasions of an area may occur during a single season; they manifest strong preference for Laminaria in the subtidal region; post-metamorphic individuals have considerable ability for dispersal; and predation by their principal predator, the labrid fish Tautogolabrus adspersus (Walbaum) is limited in time and space. Despite this potential, the estimated direct consumption of kelp laminae by snails was negligible, amounting to only ??? 0.05 {\%} of the total blade biomass (fresh wt) that was available during their season. However, the snails??? overall impact on the Laminaria canopy was significant. Because grazing was concentrated on the frilled margins of laminae, and the holdfast, stipe and intercalary meristem were largely avoided, grazing promoted the tearing away of the margins of blades, resulting in a significant reduction in canopy area without increasing kelp mortality. Since there was no grazer-induced mortality of Laminaria, the canopy was closed following the growth burst of the kelps early in the spring, and there was little opportunity for understorey species to benefit from the temporarily high light levels. If the distribution of grazing by the snails had been more uniform and caused significant mortality of Laminaria, major changes in the structure of the seaweed assemblage would have occurred. We suggest that the pattern of Lacuna grazing on Laminaria is governed by the distribution of anti-herbivore chemicals in the plants, and variations in the toughness and nutritional quality of different regions of the plant. Avoidance of the intercalary meristem correlates with high levels of polyphenols in this area. Polyphenol concentration is uniformly low throughout the rest of the plant. The distribution of snail grazing on the stipe and holdfast, and central and lateral portions of the lamina correlates with the toughness and nutritional quality of these parts. The nature of the anti-herbivore defences of Laminaria, which are effective against grazing by Lacuna but not by the urchins, indicates a trade-off between high specific growth rates and reproductive output (and thus superior competitive ability) versus development of defences. This strategy is consistent with cost-effective arguments relating resource allocation and fitness. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {Quantitative relationships were established between the recruitment of sporophytes of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.A. Agardh, and various environmental variables. Artificial substrata were inoculated with M. pyrifera zoospores in the laboratory and outplanted to a set of field stations in the San Mateo, San Onofre, and Barn kelp forests in southern California. Measurements of temperature, irradiance, seston flux and nitrogen concentration were made concurrently with estimates of sporophyte recruitment during 39 outplants from September 1977 to August 1982. Temperature, irradiance, and seston flux were significantly correlated with the density of sporophytes recruited from the outplanted gametophytes. Recruitment of sporophytes at densities {\textgreater}50 sporophytes??cm-2 represents sporophyte production by approximately 0.1{\%} of the outplanted female gametophytes. This occurred only at temperatures below 16.3??C and irradiation levels above 0.4 E??m-2??day-1. We have defined these conditions as a "recruitment window" within which sporophytes can be produced under natural conditions. Sporophyte recruitment was enhanced by fertilizing gametophytes with nitrogen and phosphorus. However, the relative level of recruitment on the fertilized substrata, which were outplanted in the late summer when sea temperatures were above 16??C, was low compared to recruitment on unfertilized substrata outplanted when temperatures were below 16??C. The irradiance requirements for sporophyte recruitment as indicated by these field studies agree well with those derived in the laboratory. Temperature, on the other hand, was negatively correlated with recruitment in the field, but had little effect (at temperatures up to 20??C) in the laboratory. These results coupled with the nutrient enrichment data indicate that a factor correlated with temperature, such as nutrient levels, may be the most important in determining recruitment success. Our results suggest that large scale temporal patterns of recruitment of giant kelp in southern California are determined, in part, by the infrequent occurrences of recruitment windows. However, proper irradiance and temperature conditions are not the sole requisites for recruitment as evidenced by a lack of recruitment on our artificial substrata during some apparent window periods. ?? 1986.},

The ranking within the three main categories differed, reflecting different strategies between the species within the three algal groups. When all categories (excluding salinity and temperature) were summed, the top five risk species, all invasive, were, in descending order, Codium fragile spp. tomentosoides, Caulerpa taxifolia, Undaria pinnatifida, Asparagopsis armata and Grateloupia doryphora, while Sargassum muticum ranked eight and Caulerpa racemosa ten.

abstract = {A diverse community of marine invertebrates is associated with suceessional algal mats in an intertidal boulder field in southern California. Species richness and abundance of invertebrates increased from early to middle suceessional stages, then remained similar into the later stage. These changes are paralleled by those in the physical structure (biomass and surface area) of the algae. Increased complexity of the algal physical structure probably influenced the associated invertebrate community through several mechanisms. (1) It decreased mortality caused by predation from fish and crabs. (2) It reduced the severity of physical stresses, primarily wave shock. (3) It increased the accumulation of those individuals and species transported passively by wave action. (4) In mobile species, selection of algal substrates was largely based on physical aspects of algal structure. While no species tested appeared to select particular algal species. all actively chose algal clumps of high biomass. All four mechanisms result in the accumulation of greater numbers of individuals in algal mats with higher biomass and surface area. Because a larger sample of the available pool of individuals is collected, more species are found in a given area of algal mat when the structure is more complex. The suceessional patterns of change in species richness of the invertebrate community seem to result from this sampling phenomenon. Laboratory experiments and correlations in abundance between pairs of species gave no evidence of any competitive interactions. Any apparent "structure" in this assemblage seems to be the result of the summation of individual responses to changing algal physical structure during succession. ?? 1987.},

In summer, nearly 30{\%} of the surface solar ultraviolet radiation (280 to 400 nm) penetrates offshore waters to 5 m depth. Experimental removal of the mature Ecklonia radiata kelp canopy in summer results in tissue damage, photopigment destruction, reduced growth, and low survivorship of subcanopy kelp sporophytes. These effects do not occur with canopy removal in winter. Laboratory experiments revealed that the UV component of radiation, rather than intense photosynthetically active radiation, was responsible for the inhibition of growth and photodamage. UV radiation probably affects survival of the settlement stages of E. radiata sporophytes, thus excluding them from otherwise suitable substrata in shallow waters.

abstract = {In the sublittoral kelp forests of New South Wales, dictyotalean turfing algae dominate the substratum in areas where kelp canopies have been removed by storms. The effects of the presence of these algae on the recruitment of kelp plants and the subsequent structure of the benthic community were determined. Areas of turfing algae in clearings were experimentally cleared of turf at a time of dense kelp settlement, and areas of the kelp canopy were also removed. These treatments were compared with unmanipulated areas of turf in clearings and areas under the kelp canopy. The number of kelp recruits in each replicate plot was recorded throughout time as were the abundances of most of the macroscopic and microscopic species living on the substratum. Kelp was found to recruit very quickly to areas of substratum which had the overlying kelp canopy removed, but few recruits appeared under the natural canopy, or in areas xvith turfing algae, or in clearings where turfing algae had been removed. The results showed that whilst the presence of a natural kelp canopy and/or turfing algae inhibited the recruitment of kelps, removal of turfing species from clearings did not facilitate kelp recruitment. This indicated that the presence of turf did not solely inhibit kelp recruitment, but some lingering influence of turf seems to affect the substratum in clearings such that kelp cannot recruit to such areas. Turfing species returned and dominated the substratum in clearings where turf had been removed. After an initial decline, encrusting species increased in abundances in clearings where kelp recruited as these recruits developed a canopy. Turf and encrusting species remained great in cover in the respective control treatments. The results are discussed in terms of alternate stable states within this community. Such concepts are concluded to be dependent upon the spatial and temporal scales of one's investigation.},

Although the plants were fertile throughout the year, fertile area per plant showed a steady increase from low values in the late summer to a peak in the spring. Spore release per unit fertile area also varied seasonally, with low release in late summer and winter, and most spores released in spring/early summer. The annual spore production is compared with other direct and indirect estimates of spore production in kelps. Despite the huge numbers of spores produced, the volume of spore material is estimated as only 5-27 cm 3 of spores per plant per year. The annual spore production represents only c. 0.17{\%} of the total production of this kelp.},

abstract = {The subtidal region at Cape Banks, New South Wales, Australia, is char- acterized by large areas covered solely by encrusting coralline algae in association with large densities of invertebrate grazers. Orthogonal removals of these grazers: the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii; the limpets Patelloida alticostata, P. mufria, and Cellana tra- moserica; and the turbinids Australium tentiforme and Turbo torquata, were done at two sites and two times to investigate the interactions among these species and their effects on the algal community. These manipulations had large effects on both the algal and animal communities, although the type and intensity of these interactions altered at different temporal and spatial scales. Initially, the removal of urchins and/or all species of limpets resulted in a rapid increase in the amount of noncrustose algae in these areas. Removal of turbinids, however, had no significant effect. Where both limpets and urchins had been removed, the cover of foliose algae continued to increase quickly and was :80-100{\%} after 12 mo. In areas where only urchins were removed, the increase in the cover of algae was slower, and only approached 100{\%} after 18-24 mo. Where only limpets had been removed, 3 mo after an initial increase in the cover of filamentous algae the cover declined to be only slightly more than in control areas. These results were similar at all sites and times. In one series of removals, the effects of some of the species of limpets were separated. In this case, the increase in the cover of algae was found to be fastest when only P. mufria was left (the urchins and other limpets removed), than when all limpets and urchins had been removed. Initially, the removal of the urchins generally resulted in a large increase in the re- cruitment and density of the limpets. Approximately 1 yr following the removal of the urchins, however, the density of adult and juvenile limpets of all species had declined to near zero. Removal of the larger species of limpets, P. alticostata and Cellana, also increased the rate of recruitment of the smaller species, P. mufria. Thus, these invertebrate grazers, especially the sea urchins, appeared to be necessary for the maintenance of the areas of crustose algae. Similarly, the sea urchins were found to be necessary for the continued presence of the limpets within these areas. The strong effects of the urchins on this community, and the application of the situation to theories concerning keystone species and facilitation, are discussed in relation to the important but more subtle effects of the limpets},

This is the first report of non-linear nutrient depletion by plants grown in the field. There was no enhancement in the initial nitrate uptake rate. In fact, nitrate uptake had to be induced in the low intertidal Gracilaria pacifica by incubating it in 30 $\mu$M nitrate for 20 min. All species took up both ammonium and nitrate simultaneously. Enteromorpha intestinalis and the high intertidal Gracilaria pacifica exhibited a 50{\%} decrease in nitrate uptake in the presence of ammonium.

Observer speed had a cntical though differential effect upon sample counts. Small or cryptic fishes were severely underesti- mated at relatively fast observer speeds because not enough time was available to search thoroughly for them. Some highly mobile species, however, were overestimated at slow speeds, due to their movement across the transect during counting penods, or to inadvertent double counting. Rotenone samples confirmed that, regardless of observer speed, highly cryptic species are largely overlooked by visual census It is suggested that observer speed should be standardzed in survey designs. Other suggestions for improving precision and accuracy of visual surveys are discussed. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Four sites were sampled in kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests occupying rocky bottom habitats along a wave exposure gradient in central California USA. Consistent between-site differences were found in the three major structural elements-the surface canopy, the understory assemblage, and the ground cover/turf assemblage-of kelp forest communities. Macrocystis pyrifera was found at all four sites, Nereocystis luetkeana only at the most exposed site. The understory kelps Laminaria setchellii and Pterygophora californica were also characteristic of exposed sites. Articulated coralline algae were more abundant at exposed sites than protected, while fleshy red algae showed the opposite pattern. All four study sites were located along 8.5 km of coastline, and thus were assumed to have available to them the same species pool for colonization. The substrate composition was the same and the amount of unconsolidated substrate was similar at all four sites. We suggest that exposure to wave-generated water motion, through its influence on the surface canopy and therefore on the amount of light reaching the bottom, is responsible for these between-site differences.},

D. potatorum populations breach the boundary condition Implied by the 3/2 power law when log(k) = 4.3; if thls law does hold for D. potatorum populations the appropriate log(k) value is likely to be around 5.0, suggesting a carrylng capacity in these systems of up to 100 kg m-2.

abstract = {Spatial and temporal variation in dispersal and recruitment of the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica and of filamentous brown algae (FBA) consisting primarily of Ectocarpus siliculosus were examined off southern California, USA. These three taxa of sublittoral brown algae show enormous differences in adult morphology and demography, but release propagules near the bottom that are similar in size, shape, and motility. Their weekly variation in recruitment was measured on replicate frosted glass slides placed at different distances from stands of fertile adults at three sites. For all taxa, significant temporal variation was observed in recruitment at the zoospore source as well as at distances out to 4000 m from the source. For the kelps, this variation was due to variable rates of both zoospore settlement and early postsettlement mortality. In general, recruitment density of both kelps rapidly declined with distance from the adult stand; significantly lower recruitment was observed at as little as 3 m away. In contrast, dispersal of FBA was much greater; no significant decrease in recruitment density was observed out to 500 m. The differences in dispersal between these two algal groups may result from behavioral differences of their zoospores. Unlike those of kelps, zoospores of FBA are positively phototactic. This enables FBA zoospores to remain in the water column longer, thus increasing the distances over which they disperse. The predominant pattern of limited dispersal in the two kelps, however, was not constant over time. Dispersal was greatly expanded during episodic periods of high recruitment that coincided with winter storms. Turbulent water flow associated with these storms may resuspend kelp zoospores normally occurring near the bottom and allow them to be transported greater distances by prevailing currents. Although species characteristics of the adult stand appeared to influence the distribution of recruits, the effect disappeared within 10 m of the stand. At a short-range study site, decreases in spatial variation in recruitment density between the zoospore source and 3 and 10 m away indicated that the distribution of zoospores became more uniform with distance. Likewise at a long-range site, recruitment out to 4000 m appeared to occur uniformly and coincided with recruitment at the zoospore source and at all intermediate distances. This uniformity and coincidence of recruitment indicated that dispersal over longer distances was probably via individual zoospores rather than via clumps of drifting plants or reproductive fragments as suggested in previous studies. Although episodic, such dispersal is probably essential in promoting the persistence of these plants in highly dis- turbed and unpredictable environments.},

abstract = {Patterns of survival of juvenile giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) were ex- amined in relation to grazing by sea urchins, shading by adult kelp, density of recruits, densities of other algal species, and substrate distribution. Survival was poorer in areas where white sea urchins (Lytechinus anamesus) were abundant or where there was an overlying canopy of adults. At other sites, the density of recruits explained the greatest proportion of variability in survival, and the proportion of juveniles that survived was negatively correlated with the number of recruits. Potential algal competitors (Pterygophora californica and Cystoseira osmundacea), red sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus), and substrate distributions had no significant effect on survival. The mechanisms of density-dependent survival were similar to "dominance and suppression" models that explain self-thinning in many terrestrial plant populations. In stands where densities of recruits were high, skewed size distributions developed, probably as the result of competition for light. High-density stands had proportionally more small plants than low-density stands, and, during subsequent storms, only the larger plants survived. This led to a more equitable distribution of survivors than would be expected based on the number of recruits. Intraspecific interactions, both between adults and juveniles and among juveniles of the same cohort, appear to be important structuring forces in most giant kelp populations. This parallels findings in many terrestrial populations. However, in other algal populations, there is little evidence for density-dependent mortality or for the dominance-suppression hypothesis. These differences may relate to competition for light, which is intense in Macrocystis forests and many terrestrial populations, but less so in assemblages of other benthic algae.},

Growth rates, survivorship, size and age at maturity, fecundity, and per-offspring parental investment were estimated from marked snails during a 3-yr period. Growth rates as indicated by changes in shell length, total mass, shell mass, and body mass varied among populations from different exposure regimes. Relative to more protected sites, snails from exposed shores grew more slowly and ter- minated growth at a smaller size. Age at maturity did not differ between whelks from high- and low-wave-energy populations, but those on the exposed shore matured at a smaller size. Mortality rates increased with wave energy. Size-specific mortality rates indicated that the higher mortality on wave-swept shores reflected decreased survivorship of large ( 15 mm) adults relative to similar sized individuals on more protected shores. Exposed shore snails deposited twice as many egg capsules with twice as many hatchlings emerging from each capsule. Although the hatchlings were -25{\%} smaller, four times as many were pro- duced, suggesting that reproductive effort was considerably greater on exposed coasts, offsetting the higher mortality rates. The ecological forces (energetic, physiological, abiotic, etc.) potentially responsible for the life history variation among populations from different wave-exposure regimes are discussed.},

The presence of Macrocystis enhanced local abundance for some species and reduced the abundance of others. For some species that were positively affected, the magnitude of the kelp effect was stronger for recently settled recruits than older juvenile and adult stages. The reduced recruitment of two benthic species appears to be related to the affinity of these fishes for understory algae, the cover of which is inversely related to the abundance of Macrocystis.

The studies that run controls typically use them to calculate a constant "correction factor," which is subtracted prior to formal data analysis. This procedure constitutes a non-rigorous suppression of variance that overstates the statistical significance of observed differ- ences. The appropriate statistical analysis for preference tests with two foods is usually a simple t-test performed on the between-food differences in loss of mass (or numbers, area, etc.) comparing the results of experimentals with consumers to controls without consumers. Application of this recommended test procedure to an actual data set illustrates how low replication in controls, which is typical of most studies of feeding preference, inhibits detection of an apparently large influence of previous mechanical dam- age (simulated grazing) in reducing the attractiveness of a brown alga to a sea urchin.},

abstract = {hree methods for estimating the average level of gene flow in natural population are discussed and compared. The three methods are FST, rare alleles, and maximum likelihood. All three methods yield estimates of the combination of parameters (the number of migrants [Nm] in a demic model or the neighborhood size [4irDa2] in a continuum model) that determines the relative importance of gene flow and genetic drift. We review the theory underlying these methods and derive new analytic results for the expectation of FST in stepping-stone and continuum models when small sets of samples are taken. We also compare the effectiveness of the different methods using a variety of simulated data. We found that the FST and rare-alleles methods yield comparable estimates under a wide variety of conditions when the population being sampled is demographically stable. They are roughly equally sensitive to selection and to variation in population structure, and they approach their equilibrium values at approximately the same rate. We found that two different maximum-likelihood methods tend to yield biased estimates when relatively small numbers of locations are sampled but more accurate estimates when larger numbers are sampled. Our con- clusion is that, although FST and rare-alleles methods are expected to be equally effective in analyzing ideal data, practical problems in estimating the frequencies of rare alleles in electrophoretic studies suggest that FST is likely to be more useful under realistic conditions.},

The data include stormy and relatively benign years and an exceptional storm which resulted in almost total destruction of a major Macrocystis forest. High orbital velocities (associated with large, high frequency waves), the presence of breaking waves, and entanglement by drifters were found to increase mortality through stipe breakage or holdfast failure. Longshore variability in wave intensity was found to affect kelp mortality rates. The data suggest that wave breaking may be an important factor in determining the inner boundary of the kelp bed.},

abstract = {Wave-swept macroalgae are constructed from materials which are brittle compared to most biological structural materials. As a consequence, these plants are susceptible to breakage when they receive a sharp-ended surface injury. Field tests indicate that injuries such as razor cuts can result in rapid mortality even under benign surf conditions. However, because algal blade material is highly extensible, it allows for a rounding of the apex of a surface flaw, resulting in a substantial lowering of the stress concentration in the material. For all but the most sharply ended initial cracks, the rounding of the flaw is sufficient to make the local stress concentration the limiting factor in fracture. in this fashion macroalgal blades manage largely to avoid the dire consequences of being constructed from brittle materials.},

Plant growth and developmental responses in this greenhouse experiment have demonstrated the effectiveness of the two kelp foliar sprays as plant growth regulating substances. Bean growth and developmental responses to the kelp foliar spray treatments were dependent upon the soil moisture regime to which they have been subjected. Although the two kelp foliar sprays had varying and sometimes contrasting effects on bean growth and N nutrition, which were dependent on the soil moisture treatment, their developmental effects upon the number of nodes, shoot/root ratio, leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were quite similar. A soybean callus bioassay demonstrated the presence of cytokinin-like substances and a callus growth antagonist in the kelp concentrate. Increasing dilution of the kelp concentrate disproportionately reduced the callus growth antagonist relative to the growth promoting or cytokinin-like activity.},

@article{Reed1990,
abstract = {Recruitment from newly settled propagules is an important process in the population dynamics of many species, especially those living in highly disturbed areas and subjected to frequent local extinctions. For many primitive plants such as kelps (large brown algae in the order Laminariales), the process of recruitment (i.e., the first appearance of macroscopic individuals) is quite complex and requires the successful completion of an alternate microscopic free-living sexual stage. To experimentally investigate the conse- quences of variable spore settlement and early (i.e., prerecruit) competition on the recruit- ment patterns of the sympatric sublittoral kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica, I seeded bare rock substrates with known densities of spores of the two algae in both single- and mixed-species assemblages. Results from 12 field experiments done over 3 yr indicated that for both kelps, a minimum density of at least 1 spore/mm2 was needed for successful recruitment. This minimum density was probably determined in part by the maximum distance that could separate male and female gametophytes while still allowing fertilization to occur. Although greater spore density often resulted in higher numbers of sporophyte recruits, strong density-dependent mortality still occurred whenever there was recruitment. The requirement for spores to settle at relatively high densities (i.e., {\textgreater} 1 spore/mm2), coupled with the drastic difference in size between spores (0.01 mm) and early recruits (20 mm), insures that density-dependent mortality will occur at early stages in these algae. "Safe sites" for the recruitment of kelp were highly variable in time; recruitment of both kelps varied significantly among experiments and was negatively correlated with the natural recruitment of ephemeral species of filamentous brown algae. Differences in post- settlement mortality between Macrocystis and Pterygophora often caused patterns of spo- rophyte recruitment to vary from those of initial spore settlement. In monospecific treat- ments, the recruitment rates of the two kelps usually differed in the same experiment, indicating they responded differently to the same environmental conditions. In mixed- species treatments, interspecific competition between microscopic prerecruit stages also caused species-specific differences in early mortality. Pterygophora spore settlement gen- erally inhibited the recruitment of Macrocystis at both high (750-1500 spores/mm2) and low (10-20 spores/mm2) densities. Competition between the two kelps was asymmetrical; Macrocystis settlement had no effect on Pterygophora recruitment. Thus, changing envi- ronmental conditions and competition among early microscopic stages modified the ways in which spore settlement influenced sporophyte recruitment. The effects of these factors on kelp recruitment were interactive, and their relative importance will undoubtedly vary with species, location, and time.},

abstract = {Previous studies demonstrated that understory kelps altered rates of mass and particulate transport beneath kelp canopies. This study examined the implications of these physical effects, plus shading by canopies, on the recruitment of four taxa of benthic invertebrates. Using field manipulations of understory kelp density and substratum orientation, we examined the effect of kelps on invertebrate recruitment and assessed the mechanisms involved. These mechanisms included reduced flow, increased sedimentation, reduced light intensity and reduced microalgal cover. All effects were significant to recruitment, but their relative importance varied among taxa. Two species examined, the serpulid polychaete Pseudochitinopoma occidental (Bush) and the cheilostome bryozoan Membranipora membranacea (Linnaeus) have long-lived planktonic larvae. Kelp canopies significantly affected recruitment of these two species, but in different ways. Pseudochitinopoma recruitment was reduced by sedimentation and light but was unaffected by ambient flow directly. Recruitment of Membranipora exhibited patterns consistent with that of passive transport of larvae with higher recruitment in high flow, no-kelp environments. Its recruitment was reduced by higher sedimentation beneath canopies, but showed no response to changes in light intensity. Spirorbid polychaetes have short planktonic phases of unknown durations. Kelps significantly affected their recruitment but difference in recruitment rates between kelp-covered and exposed substrata varied in direction with season. Spirorbid recruitment was reduced by light and high levels of sedimentation, but their recruitment patterns were unaffected by ambient flow directly. The cyclostome bryozoan Tubulipora sp. has a very short planktonic period (seconds to minutes) and factors affecting its recruitment were consequently difficult to decipher. It apparently responded negatively to higher light intensity and increased sedimentation. The effects of kelp canopies on recruitment depend on the complex interaction of these variables. ?? 1990.},

The effects of kelp are strongly related to the resources required by different life history stages of fishes. Giant kelp has a positive, direct effect on local abundances of species that use it as a nursery ground and/or adult habitat. Kelp can also indirectly affect abundances offish. These indirect effects, which can be positive or negative, result from the shading of understory algae by kelp.

Current measurements over the shelf in this region show barotropic reversals during the passage of the peak of a CTW, with essentially geostrophic flow occurring. Comparisons are made with theoretically calculated first-mode CTW characteristics along various sections of the coast. These calculated speeds fall within the range of speeds determined from observation, though an admixture of a mode 2 CTW is possible. It is found that the speeds of wind systems moving along the coast also fall in the same range, probably leading to a resonance condition, and an explanation for the large CTW amplitudes.},

abstract = {A simple method that combines guanidinium isothiocyanate RNA extraction and probing with antisense and sense RNA probes is described for analysis of microbial gene expression in planktonic populations. Probing of RNA sample extracts with sense-strand RNA probes was used as a control for nonspecific hybridization or contamination of mRNA with target DNA. This method enabled detection of expression of a plasmid-encoded neomycin phosphotransferase gene (nptII) in as few as 104 Vibrio cells per ml in 100 ml of seawater. We have used this method to detect expression of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase large-subunit gene (rbcL) in Synechococcus cultures and natural phytoplankton populations in the Dry Tortugas, Florida. During a 36-h diel study, rbcL expression of the indigenous phytoplankton was greatest in the day, least at night (1100, 0300, and 0100 h), and variable at dawn or dusk (0700 and 1900 h). These results are the first report of gene expression in natural populations by mRNA isolation and probing. This methodology should be useful for the study of gene expression in microorganisms released into the environment for agricultural or bioremediation purposes and indigenous populations containing highly conserved target gene sequences.

abstract = {Four marine red algal genera are reported from South Africa for the first time. Rhodochortonopsis spongicola was known only from Japan. Previously known only from tetrasporangial plants, female reproductive structures and cystocarps that probably belong to this species are described from Natal material. The structure of the cystocarpic plants suggests a possible classification in the Gigartinales. Intertidal specimens of a species of Halichrysis (Rhodymeniales) are compared with other species in that genus, and it is concluded that these plants are H. coalescens comb. nov. South African specimens of Gloiocladia iyoensis comb. nov. are compared with the type species of Gloiocladia (Rhodymeniales), G. furcata , and it is concluded that previously recognized distinctions between Gloiocladia and Gloioderma are untenable. The transfer of a number of species of Gloioderma and Fauchea to Gloiocladia is thus proposed, although the genus Fauchea is maintained for species with tetrasporangia in nemathecoid sori. A single cystocarpic plant and two tetrasporophytes from Natal are provisionally assigned to Microphyllum borneense (Rhodymeniales), a species previously known only from Borneo},

Mean transport from five sections near 4{\o}-5{\o}S is 19.9 Sv (1 Sv -- 10 6 m 3 s -1) northward in the upper 500 dbar, out to 120 km offshore. Below that, between 500 and 1000 dbar, there appears to be a weak variable transport of the order of 1 Sv. Comparing transports in the EACC with those in the boundary current north of Madagascar, it seems that most of the water in the upper 300 dbar of the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current goes into the EACC. Below 300 dbar there is an excess westward transport north of Madagascar which probably goes into the Mozambique Channel. At its northern end, in northern winter the EACC converges with the south-going Somali Current to form the Equatorial Countercurrent, with an eastward transport of about 22 Sv (0-300 dbar). In northern summer, the EACC merges into the north-going Somali Current.},

The results clearly revealed a significant response of the subantarctic bacterial community to macrophyte addition. Bacteria grew rapidly on freshly harvested or stranded kelp. Doubling time had a mean value of 40 h for total bacteria and 8 h for heterotrophic bacteria. Bacterial growth peaked within the first 3-5 days but declined thereafter. Both total and heterotrophic bacterial increases were higher in stranded or detritic kelp experiments than in freshly harvested kelp experiments.

This note describes changes in the struc- ture of a kelp bed at Cape Neddick (Mane, USA) after the coincident increase of M. membranacea, evaluates the poten- tial causes of the observed changes, and documents the short- term recovery of the kelp bed. Percent cover, length and density of kelps decreased significantly during 1989 through 1991 The dispersion of Laminaria spp. within the kelp bed was clumped on each sampling date at a large spatial scale (meters), while the distribution of Laminana spp. changed on a smaller from a random pattern to a clumped d{\~{}}stribut{\~{}}on spatial scale (0.25 m'). There were no consistent differences in storm intensity between years; densities of herbivores within the kelp bed were low and also have not changed between years. The coverage of M. membranacea on laminarian kelps increased 3-fold from 1989 to 1990, and the total coverage of other epiphytes decreased. It appears that the presence of M. membranacea on kelps has contributed to the defoliation of the kelp bed at Cape Neddick. This phenomenon may have important consequences to organisms that utilize kelps as habitat and shelter.},

abstract = {The lower rocky intertidal zone of many moderately exposed and exposed shores in the Gulf of Maine, USA, is co-dominated by two species of red macroalgae, Chondrus crispus Stackhouse and Mastocarpus stellatus (Stack. in With.) Guiry. These species are anatomically, morphologically, ecologically and phylogenetically similar. We quantified: 1. (1) mechanical properties of the stipe; and 2. (2) flow forces on the stipe relative to thallus area and biomass of these species, to determine mechanical and morphological characteristics that could explain the greater winter dislodgement of C. crispus thalli in mixed stands. Although stipes of both species broke at the same mean force, C. crispus stipes were relatively thick, weak and extensible compared to the relatively thin, strong and stiff stipes of M. stellatus. Risk of breakage increased with size in both species because: 1. (1) their stipes weakened with increasing cross-sectional area; and 2. (2) cross-sectional area of the stipe failed to increase in linear proportion to frond area. Drag on C. crispus thalli of {\textgreater} 3 g fresh weight was greater than on M. stellatus of the same biomass, whereas drag on smaller fronds ( {\textless} 3 g fresh weight) of the two species was similar. Drag on large C. crispus thalli was greater mainly because they exhibit greater surface area for a given biomass than do large M. stellatus. Dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces has more severe ecological consequences for M. stellatus because regeneration from holdfasts is slower than in C. crispus. A reduced surface area:biomass ratio coupled with greater strength may lessen wave-induced disturbance and be important to maintaining a high abundance of M. stellatus in the low intertidal zone of wave-swept shores. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Sea otters had occupied the area for over two decades. Sea urchin density and size distribution were sampled during 1984-1986 to determine recruit-ment and mortality patterns. Growth rates were obtained from tetracycline-labeled individuals and changes in size-frequency modes. Periodic collections were made to ex-amine gut contents and the relationship of diet to food availability. The interaction of recruitment and mortality resulted in a dynamic population structure. Mean densi-ties ranged from 6.5 to 12.7 urchins 0.25 m -2. The popu-lation consisted primarily of urchins up to 40 mm in test diameter in a size distribution which changed from uni-modal to bimodal and back over the 2 yr study. Mortality was temporally variable and related to test diameter. Growth rates were somewhat lower than most previous reports for the species and suggested that most of the population was made up of 1 and 2 yr-old individuals. Diet consisted largely of geniculate coralline algae, with fleshy brown algae becoming important when available as drift. This study showed high densities of small urchins can exist in a California kelp forest inhabited by sea ot-ters, but regular recruitment may be necessary to main-tain such populations.},

abstract = {Four transitional life history stages are generally recognized for benthic marine algae. On the basis of differences in size, we propose two more: young germlings and young juveniles. Three of these (spores or zygotes, young germlings, and germlings) are considered early post-settlement (EPS) stages. Many of the available data on recruitment and mortality were not collected with EPS stages specifically in mind, and considerable extrapolation and inference are required to interpret effects on early phases. Data on EPS stages, and grazing in particular, are based on the disappearance of early stages (laboratory or field experiments, including outplantings), on indirect information on mortality from manipulations of grazers or juvenile stages, and combinations of observation and manipulation. We also provide original data on the effects of water motion and canopy sweeping on zygote mortality. The most notable finding is the variability in, and multiplicity of, factors preventing successful recruitment of early life stages. Six intrinsic and about 17 extrinsic factors and/or processes were reported to affect recruitment and mortalit F. Grazing, canopy, and turf effects appear to be most important, but less well studied factors such as desiccation and water motion may be as important for early stages. Our review indicates that recruitment is highly variable, even episodic, and that mortality at this period is high. Combined, these elements suggest that chance events during EPS stages may play a large role in survival, and perhaps the evolution of benthic algae.},

These variables include synchro- nous release of gametes, plant architecture, immobilization of female gametes, cytological specializations (e.g., in the spermatia of some red algae), agglutinins, and a number of important aspects of water motion. Little is known about fertilization success in unicellular algae, but various aspects (gametogenesis, resting zygotes) of reproduction in such algae are considered.

abstract = {This paper addresses questions of community and patch stability as defined by the population biology of dominant plants in the context of different areas within a large kelp forest. We ask (1) Do large-scale episodic events override biological mechanisms as a major community structuring process?, (2) Are different local areas characterized by different processes?, and (3) How persistent are the patches or biological structure over decadal and local spatial scales? We evaluate these questions with regard to the effects of various types of disturbance for as much as three decades on the populations of several species of kelp in the large kelp forest off Point Loma, San Diego, California. The most sensitive population factors we studeind include recruitment, density and survivorship. Patch stabilty was evaluated with regard to the persistence of patches already well established in 1971-1972. The study sites offer a cross-shore transect through the central part of a large kelp forest at depths of 8, 12, 15, 16 and 21 m; two aditional sites at the north and south ends of the forest offer a longshore transect along the 18-m contour. There were marked differences among the decades with regard to the intensity of the disturbances. Compared with th e1980's, the two preceding decades were relatively benign. The 1980's had two extreme disturbance events: the 1982-1984 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was the most severe El Nino event in the last century, which included very warm, nutrient-depleted water, and a short but in intense storm in January 1988 appeared to have been the most severe in perhaps 200 yr. The storm changed age-specific kelp mortality patterns and caused the first large-scale understory mortality in several decades. By sweeping away drift algae it caused intense local urchin grazing. The storm was followed by a strong La Nina event marked by cool, nutrient-rich water in 1988-1989. Differences in kelp recruitment and survivorship in different areas of the kelp forest are influenced by gradients in longshore currents, temperature, light, wave energy, floc, planktonic propagules, and physical disturbance. The areas are characterized by different plant population patterns and the effects of several speceis of herbivores. The massive disturbances of the 1980s obliterated much of the structure in the kelp forest. Certainly the disturbances caused many lag effects including outbreaks of understory algae such as Desmarestia ligulata, intraspecific competition, changes in grazing paterns, etc., which in turn resulted in between-area variatino in recovery rates. However, in all cases this variation was overshadowed by the overwhelming competiitive dominance of Macrocystis pyrifera. Most of the understory patches on the transect liens, some of which had persisted for 7 yr, died out by the end of 1990. The population biology of Macrocystis was remarkably similar in most areas, as the cohort longevity and survivorship curves were very similar, and the plant and stipe densities tended to level off in only a few years. Thus large-scale episodic events such as El Ninos, La Ninas, and rare storms exert dramatic mpacts, but small-scale responses such as density-vague recruitment (neither density dependent nor density independent) and survival allow prompt recovery, often to preexisting patterns. The one exception was the southern site, which was marked by sea urchin grazing and poor kelp recruitment through the latter half of the 1980s, but a recent sea urchin disease event has led to kelp recruitment in fall 1991. A seeming paradox to the observed Macrocystis dominance is that in almost all areas, some understory patches of old plants have persisted through the 1980s.},

abstract = {Four transitional life history stages are generally recognized for benthic marine algae. On the basis of differences in size, we propose two more: young germlings and young juveniles. Three of these (spores or zygotes, young germlings, and germlings) are considered early post- settlement (EPS) stages. Many of the available data on recruitment and mortality were not collected with EPS stages specifically in mind, and considerable extrapolation and inference are required to interpret effects on early phases. Data on EPS stages, and grazing in particular, are based on the disappearance of early stages (laboratory or field experiments, including outplantings), on indirect information on mortality from manipulations of grazers or juvenile stages, and combinations of observation and manipulation. We also provide original data on the effects of water motion and canopy sweeping on zygote mortality. The most notable finding is the variability in, and multiplicity of, factors preventing successful recruitment of early life stages. Six intrinsic and about 17 extrinsic factors and/or processes were reported to affect recruitment and mortalit F. Grazing, canopy, and turf effects appear to be most important, but less well studied factors such as desiccation and water motion may be as important for early stages. Our review indicates that recruitment is highly variable, even episodic, and that mortality at this period is high. Combined, these elements suggest that chance events during EPS stages may play a large role in survival, and perhaps the evolution of benthic algae.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Are local ecological communities ever saturated with species? That is, do they ever reach a point where species from the regional pool are unable to invade the local habitat because of exclusion by resident species? 2. We review the theoretical evidence for saturation in various community models and find that non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict saturation. 3. Instead, models where coexistence is based on niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed predictions. 4. Thus, theory says that species interactions are a necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in ecological time. 5. We then argue that unsaturated (Type I) assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature and that even saturated (Type II) assemblages may not show hard limits to richness over evolutionary time-scales. 6. If local richness is not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in turn, limit local rich- ness) become important, including phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales. 7. Our speculations inevitably suggest that the principal direction of control for species richness is from regional to local. If correct, then the key to community structure may lie in extrinsic biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making community ecology a more historical science.},

abstract = {The idea that plant polyphenols act as digestibility-reducing compounds is well entrenched. This hypothesis has recently been countered with the proposal that the presence of surfactants in the gut fluids of herbivores may preclude the digestibility-reducing effects of plant polyphenols. We examined three marine isopods, three limpets, and a rock lobster, and established that surfactants are present in the digestive fluids of all of these organisms. However, further determinations of the efficacy with which these surfactants can prevent the complexation of proteins by brown-algal polyphenols in vitro revealed substantial differences between species. Moreover, in cases where the surfactants were ineffective, polyphenols reduced in vitro digestibility in a dose-dependent manner. We therefore conclude that the presence of gut surfactants does not necessarily preclude protein precipitation by polyphenols in vivo. Thus polyphenols might still be regarded as digestibility-reducing compounds, since gut surfactants only counter these effects in some cases.},

A total of 2 022 fish representing 14 species belonging to only two families - the Clinidae (88-98{\%} by number) and the Gobiesocidae (12-2{\%}) - were caught. Clinus superciliosus, C. heterodon and the gobiesocid Chorisochismus dentex were the most abundant species in terms of both numbers and biomass. Vertical zonation of individual species on the shore indicated little separation of the habitat between species, although some species exhibited size-specific partitioning of the shore. Relationships between fish distribution and abundance and rock pool characteristics were elucidated by means of stepwise multiple regression, both at the whole community and individual species levels. The abundances of individual species were best predicted by pool size, although some species also showed an association with weed cover. For the community as a whole, the number of species present, the total number of fish and the total biomass in any pool were all dependent on pool size, height above LWS and amount of available cover. Relative to other South African sites the west coast has a low diversity of intertidal fish, combined with a high degree of dominance and a low level of habitat separation.},

One method is based on estimating FST from frequencies at polymorphic sites, treating each site as a separate locus. The other method is based on computing the minimum number of migration events consistent with the gene tree inferred from their sequences. We compared the performance of these two methods on data that were generated by a computer simulation program that assumed the infinite sites model of mutation and that assumed an island model of migration. We found that in general when there is no recombination, the cladistic method performed better than FST while the reverse was true for rates of recombination similar to those found in eukaryotic nuclear genes, although FST performed better for all recombination rates for very low levels of migration (Nm = 0.1).},

Two sites in each zone were sampled for 2 yr, and variability patterns were statistically described using site or zone as classification factors. Bathymetric profiles of density showed a strong qualitative and quantitative variation among sites, contrasting with the high evenness in spatial distribution of plants per depth interval, despite intervals of varying length. Relationships among morphometric parameters changed markedly across spatial scales, producing a high variance in biomass predictions. In most cases, strong site- and zone-specific components were identified, which account for the variability in morphology at both spatial scales. Zone effects may mirror water motion and temperature regimes, among other factors, and site effects may be related to specific habitat configurations. These results show that extrapolation from structural features of single stands for characterizing species may result in misleading inferences. The detection of scale-dependent patterns proved to be a useful starting point for comparative studies of population structure, and necessary before attempting generalizations.},

abstract = {We conducted two experiments to determine the relative effects of herbivory and nutrients on an algal community in Walker Branch, a stream having effectively two trophic levels: primary producers and herbivorous snails. The first study (1989), performed in streamside channels, tested the effects of three factors: (1) stream water nitrogen (N), (2) phosphorus (P), and (3) snail grazing, on periphyton biomass, productivity, and community composition. The second study (1990), conducted in situ, tested the effects of snail grazing and nutrients (N + P). In the 1989 study, nutrients had positive effects, and herbivores had negative effects, on algal biomass (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass, total algal biovol? ume) and primary productivity (area- and chlorophyll-specific). Likewise, both nutrients and snail grazing exerted effects (+ and -, respectively) on biomass measured in the 1990 study (chlorophyll a, algal biovolume). Grazed communities were dominated by chloro- phytes and cyanophytes, which were overgrown by diatoms when herbivores were removed. Algal species that were reduced most by herbivores were increased most by nutrient ad? dition, and vice versa, suggesting a trade-off between resistance to herbivory and nutrient- saturated growth rates. Increases in algal biomass and productivity were slight with the addition of either N or P compared to responses observed when both nutrients were added together, suggesting that both nutrients were at growth-limiting levels. The greatest changes in periphyton structure or function were observed when both nutrients were added and simultaneously, grazers were removed, in contrast to lesser effects when nutrients were added under grazed conditions or grazers were removed at low nutrient levels, indicating dual control by both factors. Nutrient addition also positively affected snail growth in both experiments, indicating tight coupling between herbivore and algal growth (top-down ef? fects) and that bottom-up factors that directly affected plant growth could also indirectly affect consumers belonging to higher trophic levels. Indices quantifying the direct effects of top-down factors relative to bottom-up factors (top-down index, TDI) and the importance of interactions between these factors (interaction coefficient, IC) were computed. These indices showed that the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up factors varied among biomass and productivity parameters and that top-down and bottom-up effects, alone, were less important than their combined effects.

VTs were incapable of resolving many of the less common red algae. Video sampling required less time in the field than point quadrats but laboratory analysis was very time consunling. Lack of resolution and extensive laboratory analysis make this technique insufficient for sampling benthic red algal populations. However, VTs may be useful in documenting large-scale differences between regions, such as the percent cover of understory kelps or the density of large mobile invertebrates in central California kelp forests.

abstract = {Experimental physical disturbances on the assemblages of understorey species living in sublittoral kelp forests in central New South Wales were examined across several spatial and temporal scales. Experimental clearing of kelp canopies (mimicking damage done during storms) and subsequent macro- and microscopic sampling of cleared areas, edges of clearings and uncleared, control areas of natural kelp forest were done over a 14-month period across several spatial scales: three replicate patches of clearings and controls (3-5 m apart) in each of two sites (10-20 m apart) in each of two kelp forests (0.2-5 km apart) in each of four locations (20-140 km apart). Despite large variations in abundances and temporal fluctuations, there were some similarities in responses to disturbance by several taxa in most locations. The covers of holdfasts of Ecklonia radiata and encrusting algae decreased in the centres of most clearings in most kelp forests as plots became overgrown, first by microscopic filamentous algae and then by macroscopic foliose algae. While these changes occurred, a layer of sediment increased in cover in clearings and the species richness of the assemblage declined. Assemblages on the edges of clearings often showed effects intermediate between those in the centres of clearings and those under the natural canopy. In some forests, juveniles of Ecklonia radiata recruited, but this tended to occur toward the edges of clearings where the covers of microalgae, turf and sediment were least. The presence of turfing species in the centres of clearings also seemed to preclude the successful establishment of some sponges and an ascidian during their periods of recruitment. The microscopic and turfing algae which colonized clearings were different in different places, as were the periods after clearing before they colonized. Species that were fairly uniform in their responses to disturbance were common, occurring in similar abundances in most places. Temporal variability showed that some fluctuations occurred over a matter of weeks (e.g. the microscopic organisms), others occurred over several months (foliose algae), whilst the largest time-scale involved the recovery of the disturbed kelp canopy over the full duration of the experiment. Despite significant small-scale spatial patchiness in the responses of taxa to disturbances, these effects were fairly consistent within a particular forest. The results are discussed in terms of current theories of patch dynamics, as they apply to our understanding of kelp systems. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {We describe an approach to investigating and understanding the interactions between vegetation structure and ecosystem processes that uses simulation models as a framework for comparison and synthesis across ecosystems arrayed along environmental gradients. The models are individual-based vegetation simulators and compartment models of nutrient cycling and soil water relations. Applications focus on interactions and feedbacks between vegetation structure (species composition, size structure) and ecosystem processes (water balance, nutrient cycling), and how these relationships vary across environmental gradients. Preliminary results indicate that life-history traits of plants have a profound influence on system-level behaviors, and that differences between grasslands and forests can be attributed largely to contrasting traits of grasses and trees. Experiments with linked vegetation-ecosystem process models diverge from simulations with either model run independently, suggesting the importance of feedbacks between details of vegetation pattern and ecosystem processes. The development of a fully coupled vegetation-ecosystem process model that is sufficiently general to simulate systems dominated by multiple lifeforms presents several conceptual, logistical, and scaling challenges, but also provides for new opportunities in ecosystem theory. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {We formulated a dynamic model with linear wave theory to predict the effects of wave height, wave length, and water depth on modulation of the local surface cover in a Macrocystis pyrifera canopy. This model was incorporated into a general model for attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in a A4. pyrifera forest with particular emphasis on light reaching understory algae. The model predicts that the period of fluctuations of PAR on the bottom matches that of the dominant wave period and that the amplitude of irradiance peaks is increased by positive local surface areal stain during the trough of a wave. Field measurements of instantaneous irradiance and surface elevation and simultaneous video recording of the surface canopy allowed investigation of these predictions. Cross-correlation analysis on irradiance and surface elevation measurements showed a significant negative correlation between surface elevation and PAR reaching the understory. This correlation cannot be attributed to the decrease in light- path length alone, but can be explained by the change in M. pyrifera surface cover. Measured changes in instantaneous fractional canopy cover exceeded theoretically predicted values by a factor of as much as 3. Consequently, the intensities of light flecks exceeded predictions. A combination of mechanisms, as well as assumptions of the model, may explain the deviation between the magnitudes of predicted and measured fluctuations in canopy cover and light. The dominant period of ocean swells is typically in the range of 5-20 s, and light flashes with these periods have been shown to effect significant gains in light utilization efficiency by certain algae},

Analysis of the changes in abalone abundance at numerous locations suggests that this is the result of an infectious disease spreading slowly from the south side of Santa Cruz Island. However, this might not be due to a directly transmitted disease and we have found no agent of infection. As with many diseases, warm temperatures acted to increase mortality rates. Our results were not consistent with other hypotheses for the decline such as over-harvesting, pollution, or factors related to physiological stresses induced by the strong El Nino of 1983-84, including warm temperatures, starvation and competition.},

abstract = {We present theory clarifying the general behavior of FST-based and GST-based estimators of gene flow, and confirm these predictions with simulations. In particular, we use the correlation of genes within groups within populations to define an estimator. The theoretical value of the correlation doe not depend on the number of groups in a population, and properties of the estimated correlation do not depend on the number of groups sampled or the number of individuals sampled per group. This invariance is in contrast to properties of GST. For a complete census of a population, bias and variance considerations would suggest the use of the GST-based estimator of gene flow, but lack of knowledge of population size or group number in practice suggests preference be given to the correlation-based estimator. We acknowledge that these estimators require that several conditions of a population-genetic model be met, since they do not make use of direct observations on the flow of genes. Our results differ from some of those based on simulation in a series of recent papers by M. Slatkin.},

Removal of all sea urchins caused the loss of the Barrens habitat and the development of an assemblage of foliose algae. Foliose algae did not successfully colonize treatments in which only some sea urchins were removed. Partial removals caused reductions in the size of patches that were not linearly related to density.

@article{Menge1994,
abstract = {The usefulness and generality of the keystone species concept has recently been questioned. We investigated variation in interaction strength between the original keystone predator, the seastar Pisaster ochra- ceus, and its primary prey, mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus). The study was prompted by differences in community structure at two low zone sites along the central Oregon coast, Boiler Bay (BB) and Strawberry Hill (SH). Predators, especially seastars, were larger and more abundant at SH than at BB. Further, sessile animals were more abundant and macrophytes were less abundant at SH. Predators were more abundant at wave-exposed sites at both sites, and at SH, sessile invertebrates were more abundant at the wave-exposed location and sand cover was high at the wave-protected location. To test the hypothesis that variation in- predation strength explained some of these differences, we examined the seastar-mussel interaction at locations with high and low wave exposure at both sites. Predation intensity was quantified by determining the survival of mussels in clumps (50 mussels per clump, shell length 4-7 cm) transplanted to large plots (18-163 M2) with or without seastars in the low intertidal zone. Predation effects were quantified by determining prey recolonization rates in marked quadrats in the same large plots. Spatial variation in interaction strength was quantified by examining predation at scales of metres (among transplants within plots), 1 0's of metres (between replicate plots within each exposure at each site), 100's of metres (between wave exposures within locations), and 10 000's of metres (between sites). Temporal variation was evaluated by performing the experiments in 1990 and 1991. The relation between prey (mussel) recruitment and growth to differences in community structure was evaluated by quantifying recruitment density in plastic mesh balls (collectors) and growth of individually marked trans- planted mussels, respectively, at each site x exposure x tide level combination each month for 4 yr. Predation intensity varied greatly at all spatial scales. At the two largest spatial scales (10's of kilometres, 100's of metres), differences in both survival of transplanted mussels and prey recolonization depended on variation in seastar abundance with site, wave exposure, prey recruitment and growth, and at SH protected, the extent of sand burial. Variation at the two smallest scales (metres, 10's of metres) was high when seastars were scarce and low when seastars were abundant. Transplanted mussels suffered 100{\%} mortality in 2 wk at wave-exposed SH, but took {\textgreater} 52 wk at wave-protected BB. Seastar effects on prey recolonization were detected only at the SH wave-exposed site. Here, where prey recruitment and growth were unusually high, the mussel M. trossulus invaded and dominated space within 9 mo. After 14 mo, whelks, which increased in both size and abundance in the absence of Pisaster, arrested this increase in mussel abundance. Similar changes did not occur at other site x exposure combinations, evidently because prey recruitment was low and possibly also due to whelk predation on juveniles. Longer term results indicate that, as in Washington state, seastars prevent large adult M. californianus from invading lower intertidal regions, but only at wave-exposed, not wave-protected sites. Thus, three distinct predation regimes were observed: (1) strong keystone predation by seastars at wave- exposed headlands; (2) less-strong diffuse predation by seastars, whelks, and possibly other predators at a wave- protected cove, and (3) weak predation at a wave-protected site buried regularly by sand. Comparable experimental results at four wave-exposed headlands (our two in Oregon and two others in Washington), and similarities between these and communities on other West Coast headlands suggest keystone predation occurs broadly in this system. Results in wave-protected habitats, however, suggest it is not universal. In Oregon, keystone predation was evidently contingent on conditions of high prey production (i.e., recruitment and growth), while diffuse predation occurred when prey production was low, and weak predation occurred when environmental stress was high. Combining our results with examples from other marine and non-marine habitats suggests a need to consider a broader range of models than just keystone predation. The predictive and explanatory value of an expanded set of models depends on identifying factors distinguishing them. Although evidence is limited, a survey of 17 examples suggests (1) keystone predation is evidently not distinguished from diffuse predation by any of 11 previously proposed differences, but (2) may be distinguished by rates of prey production. Further, (3) differential predation on competitively dominant prey does not distinguish keystone from nonkeystone systems, since this interaction occurs in both types of community. Instead, differential predation on dominant prey evidently distinguishes strong-from weak-predation communities. While the key- stone predation concept has been and will continue to be useful, a broadened focus on testing and developing more general models of community regulation is needed},

abstract = {We have focused on the giant kelp Nereocystis luetkeana to examine the mechanical scaling of benthic marine organisms loaded in tension by hydrodynamic forces. If we consider simply the allometry of the kelp's morphological characters, we conclude that their stipes are underscaled relative to the blade area they support (i.e. that the kelp do not maintain stress or elastic similarity as they grow). However, a closer look at the characteristics of these kelp in the field reveals (1) that they have different blade shapes (and hence drag coefficients) and stipe material properties in different hydrodynamic environments, and (2) that they show a decrease in drag coefficient as they become larger. One consequence of these adjustments of blade and stipe morphology is that the maximum stresses in N. luetkeana stipes, when the kelp are pulled by peak tidal currents in their respective habitats, are similar for kelp of different sizes and for kelp from different sites. Hence, sessile organisms such as these kelp can, via their growth responses in different mechanical environments, show a phenomenon analogous to dynamic strain similarity. In addition, N. luetkeana also maintain a constant environmental stress factor, the ratio of the stress required to break a component of an organism (in this case the stipe) at some stage in its life to the maximum stress normally encountered in the habitat by that component during that stage (in this case, stress due to the drag on a kelp exposed to the peak tidal currents typical of the site at which it lives), both between habitats and as they grow.},

@article{Hedgecock1994,
abstract = {The hope that “biotechnology” will permit the iden- tification of geographic sources of recruitment to most marine animal populations is not well supported either by logic or fact. First, population genetics tells us that dispersal among geographic populations is expected, at equilibrium, to eliminate the very molecular genetic dif- ferences that are supposed to permit identification of geo- graphic provenance. Second, studies of allozynies and mitochondrial DNA have clearly shown that fish and in- vertebrate species with planktotrophic larvae are genetic- ally quite sindar over large regions, though not necessarily throughout their whole ranges. Genetic studies are, nev- ertheless, contributing new insights into the structure and biology of marine animal populations. One new insight is that sharp genetic subdivisions can occur in continuously distributed species, particularly those spanning biogeographic boundaries. An even more widespread observation is of very slight but significant microgeographic genetic heterogeneity embedded within broad regions of genetically very similar populations. Examples of the latter from the California Current are presented for the barnacle Balanirs glandula and the north- ern anchovy Engranlis rnovdax. Microgeographic hetero- geneity holds interest for biological oceanographers and fisheries scientists because it contradicts the logic of pop- ulation genetics as well as commonly held notions about the structure of zooplankton populations. Evidence sug- gests that genetic heterogeneity on nllcrogeographic scales results from temporal variation in the genetic composi- tion of recruits. This temporal variation could be a con- sequence of either selection on larval populations or large variance in the reproductive success of individuals, owing to chance matching of reproductive activity with win- dows of oceanographic conditions conducive to fertil- ization, larval development, retention, and recruitment. In support of the latter hypothesis, effective sizes for natural oyster populations are estimated to be only small fractions of breeding population numbers. The tempo- ral aspect of population genetic structure forges a strong interdisciplinary bridge to oceanographic research aimed at elucidating the temporally and spatially varying factors affecting recruitment.},

Our field collections along an offshore-inshore transect revealed a gradient of larval stages with a greater proportion of earlier stage larvae in the vicinity of offshore canyons, and more mature stage III and IV larvae dominating larval distributions closer to coastal habitats. An empirical trajectory model integrating larval behavior and hydrodynamic properties was then constructed to evaluate potential dispersal mechanisms. Model simulations suggested that passive drift via surface currents and wind-induced transport were insufficient conditions for offshore recruitment subsidies to coastal populations. In contrast, directional swimming of the fourth stage larvae resulted in successful dispersal to the coast within the duration of the plankton phase of H. americanus.},

Plants were grown in six light regimes: full sunlight (100{\%}), 50, 30, 20, 15, and 5{\%} of full light over a 2-month period. Measurements of growth, biomass, pigments, stable isotopes and leaf anatomy were made at the end of the experiment. Plants survived under all light treatments, even below minimum light requirements of related seagrasses. However, the experimental light levels possibly do not correspond to light reaching seagrass leaves under natural conditions. Plants grown under high light conditions (50-100{\%} light) had smaller shoots, higher biomass and productivity, less negative $\delta$13C values, lower leaf nitrogen content, less chlorophyll and more ultraviolet light absorbing pigment than plants grown under low light conditions ({\textless}20{\%} light). Photoadaptation by ultraviolet light absorbing pigment(s) was noted, with more variability in ultraviolet light pigments than in chlorophyll levels. Increased CO2demand and/or increased CO2recycling in internal gas spaces may account for the less negative $\delta$13C values in high light treatments, indicating less isotopic discrimination in seagrass leaves in high light. A saturation response of growth rates to light intensity was observed, with less substantial growth reductions at lower light intensities than observed in other seagrass shading experiments. Nutrient limitation in high light was inferred by a growth maximum at 50{\%} light level, increased root biomass and lower leaf nitrogen content in high light treatments. Overall, a wide range of morphological and physiological photoadaptive responses not previously reported in Zostera capricorni was observed. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The probability of successful dispersal by sessile benthic invertebrates is thought to strongly influence their geographic distribution and population genetics. Generally, species with long-lived planktonic larvae are expected to exhibit wider distribution patterns than those species which brood their young, due to their presumably greater potential for dispersal. In some cases, however, brooding species exhibit broad distributions and show evidence of genetic exchange with geographically distant populations. One potential factor that has been invoked as an explanation is dispersal by floating and rafting of adults and egg masses. Several studies have shown that it is possible for sessile adults to disperse on the order of several to many thousand kilometers by rafting on debris in ocean currents. With very few exceptions, however, direct evidence of rafting in the open ocean has been lacking. We present evidence of long-distance (1300 to 2000 km) dispersal of a brooding pelecypod, Gaimardia trapesina (Lamarck, 1819), in the Southern Ocean in the vicinity of Cape Horn, the Falkland Islands, and the antarctic island South Georgia (54{\~{}} 37 {\~{}} W). Data on survival and fecundity rates of G. trapesina and the prevalence of kelp rafts collected during the austral winter of 1993 indicate that dispersal by rafting can occur over ecologically relevant time scales and could potentially serve as a significant means of genetic exchange between populations.},

abstract = {Most theories for the evolution of plant chemical defences assume that defences are costly. In order to investigate the potential cost of phlorotannin production in the brown alga (kelp) Ecklonia radiata, I measured the correlation between changes in phloro- tannin levels and growth rates for E. radiata in two seasons, spring and autumn. In spring, when both phlorotannin levels and growth rates in E. radiata were highest, there was a significant negative relationship between changes in phlorotannin levels and growth, consistent with a cost of phlorotannin production. No relationship was evident in autumn, indicating that moderate levels of phlorotannins and growth could be maintained simultaneously. These and related results suggest that the cost of defence will vary as a function of (1) endogenous patterns of growth or metabolite pro- duction and (2) variation in available resources. Evi- dence for a cost of phlorotannins in E. radiata adds to the paradox of the maintenance of high levels of phlorotannins in Australasian brown algae. Key},

abstract = {To determine the patterns of occurrence and importance of indirect effects relative to direct effects in natural communities, I analyzed experimentally based studies from 23 rocky intertidal habitats. The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive rela- tionships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously iden- tified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these "classic" types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference com- petition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed "apparent predation" and "indirect defense" were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35{\%}) and apparent com- petition (25{\%}) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8{\%}) was least common in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect effects accounted for -40{\%} of the change in community structure resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24-61{\%}. The proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with web species richness, in- dicating that strong direct interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level of alteration of community structure regardless of the level of web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias toward manipulation of consumers over ma- nipulation of basal species, some predator-initiated indirect effect types were scarce while some basal species-initiated types were common. While the frequency of exploitation com- petition may have been underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this effect should have been detected in many of the studies and reported; and the most intensively studied individual webs did not report frequencies differing much from the average. This analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of theor},

abstract = {Morphological development of Laminaria hyperborea was examined at localities with different degrees of wave exposure. Biomass data were converted to estimates of annual growth of lamina, stipe and hapteron. Allocation of annual growth to the hapteron constituted a small amount of the total production, but increased with increasing wave exposure. At the most sheltered locality, lamina growth amounted to between 80 and 95{\%} of total growth in all age groups, and lamina to stipe ratios (fresh weight) were about 10. A higher portion of the annual growth was allocated to the stipe at the more wave-exposed localities. This resulted in lamina to stipe ratios of between 1 and 2 in old plants, but within these localities no gradual decrease in lamina to stipe ratio with increasing wave exposure was observed. At some localities a maximum of growth allocation to the stipe was found in the intermediate age groups. This was most pronounced at the locality with the highest density of canopy plants and intermediate wave exposure. Also, at this locallty the stipes were longer in relation to their weight than at the other localities. These results indicate that light environment, in additlon to wave exposure, Inay influence the stipe morphology and the relationship between stipe and lamina growth. At one station stipe growth was also calculated in individual tagged plants using the length-weight relationship. The results agreed with those obtained by the biomass method. The highest allo-cation of growth to the stipes was found in 3 and 4 yr old plants. Maximum annual stipe growth (weight increase) occurred in 4 and 5 yr old plants and decreased in older plants, while maximum lamina growth was found in the oldest plants.},

abstract = {The structure of rocky intertidal communities may be influenced by large-scale patterns of productivi- ty. In this study we examine the in situ rates of pro- duction by intertidal epilithic microalgae (chlorophyll a production per unit area per month), intertidal nutrient concentrations (nitrates, nitrites, phosphates and sili- cates), and standing stocks of different functional-form groups of macroalgae around the South African coast, and their relationships to consumer biomass. Clear gradi- ents of in situ intertidal primary production and nutrient concentrations were recorded around the South African coast, values being highest on the west coast, intermedi- ate on the south and lowest on the east coast. Primary production by intertidal epilithic microalgae was corre- lated with nutrient availability and could also be related to nearshore phytoplankton production. The dominance patterns of different functional forms of macroalgae changed around the coast, with foliose algae prevalent on the west coast and coralline algae on the east coast. However, overall macroalgal standing stocks did not re- flect the productivity gradient, being equally high on the east and west coasts, and low in the south. Positive rela- tionships existed between the average biomass of inter- tidal invertebrate consumers (grazers and filter-feeders) and intertidal productivity, although only the grazers were directly "connected" to in situ production by epi- lithic intertidal microalgae. The maximum body size of a widely distributed limpet, Patella granularis, was also positively correlated with level of in situ primary pro- duction. The maximal values of biomass attained by intertidal filter-feeders were not related to intertidal pri- mary production, and were relatively constant around the coast. At a local scale, filter-feeder biomass is known to be strongly influenced by wave action. This implies that the local-scale water movements over-ride any effects that large-scale gradients of primary production may have on filter-feeders. The large-scale gradient in inter- tidal productivity around the coast is thus strongly linked with grazer biomass and individual body size, but any effect it has on filter-feeder biomass seems subsidiary to the local effects of wave action.},

The ecological implicationsfor the Point Loma kelp forest community were studied by comparing long term data with conditions during and after the spill. Surface ammonium concentrations within 1 km of the break were at potentially toxic levels, and light levels were reduced enough to have inhibited kelp germination and growth. However, because of El Nin”o conditions, it is unlikely that kelp would have germinated in the absence of a spill. Beyond 1 km, high ammonium concentrations benefitted the nutrient-depleted surface canopy of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Measured sedimentation rates were significantly higher near the outfall during the spill and were strongly related to wave height; water motion, however, prevented sediment accumulation. Bioassays were conducted on a grid of stations surrounding the outfall. There were sign{\$}cant reductions in the density and growth of microscopic sporophytes of Macrocystis out- planted near the outfall during the spill, but this pattern disappeared in samples collected 11 dafter the repair was completed and was not observed again. Sediments collected near the outfall during the spill significantly reduced Macrocystis germ tube elongation; a post repair assay showed no dtflerences with respect to the outfall. No sign{\$}cant effects were observed in outplants of juvenile Macrocystis sporophytes, cup corals, and juvenile abalones.

Tegner et al. established animal populations. Kelp population dynamics at the permanent sites were predictable from existing population structure and El NiZo condi- tions. Damage to kelps, apparently resulting from a combination of low light and nutrient conditions with mechanical damage from storms, construction activity, and barge anchor cables, was observed along the outfall immedi- ately adjacent to the break point. Shortly after the outfall was repaired, upwelling improved conditions for kelp germination and growth, and the zone of maximum impact developed into a dense kelp forest. Suspension feeders, detritivores and sea urchins, whose natural history indicates they could have been aflected by the spill, showed no unusual population changes. In the context of the continuum of disturbances observed in two decades of population studies at Point Loma, the spill was a modest disturbance simi- lar to the natural vagaries of kelp recruitment. We emphasize that this spill was an intense but not chronic impact during an El Nina event that also stressed control areas. However, it is representative of massive spills in coastal regions, and the fact that a sewage spill of this magnitude had no lasting eflects on a kelp forest community is of general interest},

abstract = {Settlement of the mytilid, Choromytilus chorus, in the Marine Reserve of Mehuin, Chile, occurs on three different types of filamentous structures: (1) the filamentous alga Gymnogongrus furcellatus; (2) the byssus of adult Choromytilus; and (3) the byssus of the small mytilid Semimytilus algosus. Observations made in permanent plots suggest that only the individuals that recruited on the red alga, G. furcellatus, had a high probability of survival. The main agent of post-settlement mortality was the predatory whelk Nucella crassilabrum. Laboratory feeding trials show that the whelk prefers the small sizes of this mussel (1 to 3 cm in length) and above this size the mussel is largely free from whelk predation. Field observations confirm that mussel recruits remain attached to this alga for approximately a year and then they become fixed to the rocky substratum. A field experiment was done to test whether the alga did indeed provide a refuge from whelk predation. Survival of mussel recruits that had settled naturally on artificial collector was monitored. An artificial collector (Gymnogongrus imitation made with plastic nets) that was attached at only a single point to the substratum, restricted access of Nucella, and produced a correspondingly high level of survival among the mussel recruits. Alternately, an artificial collector fixed to the substratum at several point, allowed free access to Nucella and mussel survival was significantly lower. These result indicate that Gymnogongrus provides Choromytilus recruits with a short term refuge from predation. By restricting access of the whelk Nucella, Gymnogongrus allows Choromytilus recruits to reach a size at which Nucella is no longer a threat, ensuring the successful attachment of Choromytilus to the primary substratum. This algal refuge has important implications for the structure and dynamics of the Choromytilus rocky shore community.},

abstract = {Multiscale patterns of spatial and temporal variation in density and population structure were used to evaluate the generality of a three—trophic—level cascade among sea otters (Enhydra lutris), invertebrate herbivores, and macroalgae in Alaska. The paradigm holds that where sea otters occur herbivores are rare and plants are abundant, whereas when sea otters are absent herbivores are relatively common and plants are rare. Spatial patterns were based on 20 randomly placed quadrats at 153 randomly selected sites distributed among five locations with and four locations without sea otters. Both sea urchin and kelp abundance differed significantly among locations with vs. without sea otters in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska. There was little (Aleutian Islands) or no (southeast Alaska) overlap between sites with and without sea otters, in plots of kelp density against urchin biomass. Despite intersite variation in the abundance of kelps and herbivores, these analyses demonstrate that sea otter predation has a predictable and broadly generalizable influence on the structure of Alaskan kelp forests. The percent cover of algal turf and suspension feeder assemblages also differed significantly (although less dramatically) between locations with and without sea otters. Temporal variation in community structure was assessed over periods of from 3 to 15 yr at sites in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska where sea otters were 1) continuously present, 2) continuously absent, or 3) becoming reestablished because of natural range expansion. Kelp and sea urchin abundance remained largely unchanged at most sites where sea otters were continuously present or absent, the one exception being at Torch Bay (southeast Alaska), where kelp abundance varied significantly through time and urchin abundance varied significantly among sites because of episodic and patchy disturbances. In contrast, kelp and sea urchin abundances changed significantly, and in the expected directions, at sites that were being recolonized by sea otters. Sea urchin biomass declined by 50{\%} in the Aleutian Islands and by nearly 100{\%} in southeast Alaska following the spread of sea otters into previously unoccupied habitats. In response to these different rates and magnitudes of urchin reduction by sea otter predation, increases in kelp abundance were abrupt and highly significant in southeast Alaska but much smaller and slower over similar time periods in the Aleutian Islands. The different kelp colonization rates between southeast Alaska and the Aleutian Islands appear to be caused by large—scale differences in echinoid recruitment coupled with size—selective predation by sea otters for larger urchins. The length of urchin jaws (correlated with test diameter, r2 = 0.968) in sea otter scats indicates that sea urchins {\textless}15—20 mm test diameter are rarely eaten by foraging sea otters. Sea urchin populations in the Aleutian Islands included high densities of small individuals ({\textless}20 mm test diameter) at all sites and during all years sampled, whereas in southeast Alaska similarly sized urchins were absent from most populations during most years. Small ({\textless}30—35 mm test diameter) tetracycline—marked urchins in the Aleutian Islands grew at a maximum rate of °10 mm/yr; thus the population must have significant recruitment annually, or at least every several years. In contrast, echinoid recruitment in southeast Alaska was more episodic, with many years to perhaps decades separating significant events. Our findings help explain regional differences in recovery rates of kelp forests following recolonization by sea otters.},

abstract = {The morphology of Potamogeton pectinatus L. varies markedly between two sites, with different degrees of wave exposure, in the northern Baltic proper. To study the morphological variation attributable to phenotypic plasticity, tubers and sediment were reciprocally transplanted between the two sites. Several plant characters respond plastically to sediment type. The average values in muddy compared with sandy sediment was: for plant dry weight 1.0 g and 0.4 g; for total rhizome length 1.3 m and 0.6 m; for root:shoot ratio 0.08 and 0.21 respectively. Plants collected at the sheltered site were significantly more phenotypically plastic in total growth and rhizome length, than plants originating from the exposed site. The size of the transplanted tubers had a significant impact on growth and survival of the plants. Shoot length and branching were greatly affected by the above-sediment conditions, i.e. mainly wave exposure. The shoots were on average 21 cm tall at the sheltered site and only 10 cm at the wave exposed site. This was mainly due to a plastic response in internode length and to a minor extent to dislodgement of shoot parts. Many of the observed plastic responses in morphology of P. pectinatus result from phenotypic plasticity in growth. The plasticity in the root:shoot ratio to the nutrient content of the sediment and the plasticity in growth pattern to the degree of wave exposure are however suitable adjustments in resource allocation to the environmental conditions. All measured characters showed significant phenotypic plasticity in the experiment, nevertheless large morphological differences remained between plants from the two sites, when grown under the same environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {nvestigators working in both terrestrial and marine systems hypothesize that prey defenses are better developed in tropical than in temperate habitats because tropical consumers are more active and diverse. To investigate the hypothesis that chemical defenses are more potent in tropical than in temperate seaweeds, we conducted 38 feeding assays involving seven genera of algae. We offered tropical and temperate sea urchins the choice of a temperate alga from North Carolina or a closely related tropical alga from the Bahamas. Plants were freeze-dried, ground to a fine powder, embedded in agar, and presented in congeneric pairs (North Carolina species vs. Bahamian species), or same-species pairs, to the temperate urchin Arbacia punctulata and the tropical urchin Lytechinus variegatus. For the genera we tested (the red alga Amphiroa, the green alga Udotea, and the brown algae Dictyopteris, Dictyota, Lobophora, Padina, and Sargassum), we documented a general pattern in which the mean amount of North Carolina seaweeds eaten was approximately twice that of their Bahamian congeners. Dictyota was an exception to the overall pattern, in that mean consumption of temperate and tropical species was equivalent. In addition to showing a latitudinal difference in seaweed palatability, we found that some species ex- hibited significant, between-population variation in herbivore resistance on a local scale. The most notable example was Dictyota menstrualis from North Carolina. When collected from a shallow inshore site, this species was significantly more palatable than tropical species of Dictyota in four of six contrasts. When collected from a deeper offshore site, it was significantly less palatable than the tropical species in four of six contrasts. Thus, for this species, the between-population variance in palatability within a geographic region (North Carolina) bracketed the variance in palatability that we found among species and between regions. Feeding assays with both temperate and tropical urchins produced similar results, in- dicating that choices were made based on fundamental characteristics of the algae rather than on greater familiarity with local prey species. To see if chemical defenses could explain the differences in herbivore resistance that we noted using freeze-dried algae, we tested the effects of lipid-soluble and water-soluble extracts from each alga on urchin feeding by incorporating extracts into a standard palatable food. We also measured protein content and percent ash-free dry mass of the seaweeds in order to correlate urchin feeding preferences with these measures of food quality. Lipophilic chemical extracts explained urchin pref- erences in 9 of 15 (60{\%}) North Carolina-Bahamas contrasts. Water-soluble extracts, protein content, and percent ash-free dry mass generally did not account for feeding patterns seen in the original assays. Our results support the general hypothesis that tropical seaweeds have stronger chemical defenses than temperate seaweeds. For some genera, however, smaller-scale local variability in herbivore resistance within a species can be as striking as overall latitudinal differences},

Predicted maximal tensions are close to those measured in the field. The strength of Macrocystis pyrifera stipes was measured, allowing our prediction of forces to be translated into a prediction of the fraction of stipes broken. Predicted breakage is low even for extreme storm waves, a testament to the mechanical design of individual kelp fronds. However, empirically measured rates of kelp mortality can be high, considerably higher than those predicted on the basis of hydrodynamic forces acting alone. This indicates that factors not taken into account in our model (such as holdfast dislodgment, entanglement of stipes, damage from herbivory and wave breaking) contribute substantially to mortality in Macrocystis pyrifera.},

Some variables (temperature, salinity, total inorganic nitlogen and total phosphate) were analyzed to determine the oceano- graphic characteristics influencing the studied sites. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Ordination Factorial Analysis of Correspondence (FAC) were used to determine the structure of the macroalgae community in this area. The sites influenced by the upwelling waters showed lower water temperature values and higher nutrient concentrations in the spring-summer upweUing period. The benthic flora survey recorded elements with warm temperate affinities (i.e. Ceramium diaphanum (Lightfoot) Roth, Polysiphonia decussata Hollenberg and Endarachne binghamiae J. Agardh) and algae with tropical affmities (i.e. Gelidiopsis gracilis (Kiitzing) Vickers, Dictyota cervicornis Kiitzing and Caulerpa racemosa (Forssk{\~{}}l) J. Agardh). In general the local flora showed a peak in reproduction during the spring-summer period. The multivariate analysis distinguished the sites influenced by upwelling waters, and some samples taken in the same inlet suggested that further differences in the floral composition were due to wave exposure.},

abstract = {Reef habitats in the South Atlantic Bight comprise only a small proportion of the available benthic habitat, but support enormous densities of fishes, invertebrates, and algae. Because these reefs are distant from shore and in deeper waters (usually {\textgreater}20 m), we know very little about the factors affecting the distribution of fishes or the structure of fish assemblages on these reefs. Our goal in this study was to deternune how variance in macroalgal structure and species composition on reefs off the coast of North Carolina affects reef fishes. Manipulations of algal density and species composition in artificially created 1.5 m2 plots indicated that: (1) patches with Sargassum fil{\~{}}pendula had greater num- bers and higher specles richness of reef fishes than patches without algae; (2) fishes responded to vari- ability in Sargassum density with high fish abundance in patches with higher algal dens{\~{}}ty, but this response varied among fish species; (3) greater numbers of individuals and species of fish used Sar- gassum patches compared to patches of 2 other brown algae common in this region (Zonaria and Dic- tyoptens); (4) fish densities were higher in patches with taller algae and greater percent cover of algae. Many of the fishes using experimental patches were small, young-of-the-year individuals. Our results indicate that variability in the structure of seaweed beds on reefs in the South Atlantic Bight can influ- ence the distribution and abundance of reef fishes. Although the algal beds in the South Atlantic Bight are more diminutive and less extensive than kelp beds of cold temperate waters, they may be a critical habitat for juvenile reef fishes in this region, and the algal species dominating the beds will have a large effect on their value as juvenile habitat.

Acrylic pigment grains of 1 - and 1 O-pm diameter traced the intrusion of particulate matter into sandy sediment (k {\textgreater} 2 x 10-l l m2) incubated in a laboratory flume. Increased pressure up- and downstream of small mounds (z = 2.5 cm) drove water 5.5 cm into the core, carrying suspended particles (1 pm) to 2.2-cm sediment depth within 10 h. Simultaneously, decreased pressure at the downstream slope of the protrusions drew pore fluid from deeper layers (z 5 10 cm) to the surface. In the sediment, friction reduced the velocity of the particulate tracers, resulting in size fractionation and layers of increased particle concentration. Ripple topography (0.8-2.8 cm high) enhanced interfacial particle (1 pm) flux by a factor 2 .3 when compared to a level control core. The pathways of the particle and solute tracers below a sediment ripple are explained with a source-sink model that describes the pore flow velocity field.

abstract = {Growth rates of intertidal snails vary among populations differentially exposed to wave action: individuals from sheltered habitats typically grow more quickly than do those from more exposed coasts. A series of field and laboratory experiments were conducted to separate the genetic and phenotypic components of this variation in Nucella lapillus (L.) and to investigate the extent to which prey type and foraging time, which also vary across the wave- exposure gradient, affect growth. Juvenile and adult whelks were reciprocally transplanted between an exposed and a protected shore and subsequent growth followed. Independent of origin, whelks grew more on the sheltered shore. By contrast, growth rates for snails from exposed and protected shores were similar when reared under uniform conditions in the laboratory. Together these findings suggest that the variation observed in nature does not represent genetic differentiation, but reflects the influence of proximal factors that depress growth on wave-swept shores. Growth rates of juveniles from exposed and protected shores maintained in the laboratory on a diet of an overabundance of (1) barnacles, (2) mussels, (3) both, and (4) both, but only 67{\%} of the time, indicated that prey type and foraging time affect growth. Whelks grew best on a diet of mussels, either singly or in combination with barnacles, grew less on barnacles alone, and least when foraging time was restricted. Because growth rates on specific prey in the laboratory were opposite the observed trend in nature, variation in prey across the exposure gradient cannot be invoked to account for the difference in growth between N. lapillus from exposed and protected shores. The slower growth rates when foraging time was restricted are consistent with the notion that wave energies on exposed coasts depress growth by limiting foraging time or by reducing foraging efficiency.},

abstract = {We investigated the usefulness of a novel DNA fingerprinting technique, AFLP, which is based on the selective amplification of genomic restriction fragments by PCR, to differentiate bacterial strains at the subgeneric level. In totals, 147 bacterial strains were subjected to AFLP fingerprinting: 36 Xanthomonas strains, including 23 pathovars of Xanthomonas axonopodis and six pathovars of Xanthomonas vasicola, one strain of Stenotrophomonas, 90 genotypically characterized strains comprising all 14 hybridization groups currently described in the genus Aeromonas, and four strains of each of the genera Clostridium, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Vibrio. Depending on the genus, total genomic DNA of each bacterium was digested with a particular combination of two restriction endonucleases and the resulting fragments were ligated to restriction halfsite-specific adaptors. These adaptors served as primer-binding sites allowing the fragments to be amplified by selective PCR primers that extend beyond the adaptor and restriction site sequences. Following electrophoretic separation on 5{\%} (w/v) polyacrylamide/8.3 M urea, amplified products could be visualized by autoradiography because one of the selective primers was radioactively labelled. The resulting banding patterns, containing approximately 30-50 visualized PCR products in the size range 80-550 bp, were captured by a high-resolution densitoscanner and further processed for computer-assisted analysis to determine band-based similarity coefficients. This study reveals extensive evidence for the applicability of AFLP in bacterial taxonomy through comparison of the newly obtained data with results previously obtained by well-established genotypic and chemotaxonomic methods such as DNA-DNA hybridization and cellular fatty acid analysis. In addition, this study clearly demonstrates the superior discriminative power of AFLP towards the differentiation of highly related bacterial strains that belong to the same species or even biovar (i.e. to characterize strains at the infrasubspecific level), highlighting the potential of this novel fingerprinting method in epidemiological and evolutionary studies.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems include a subset in which at least some interrelated geochemical, biochemical, physiological, population and community characteristics are changed by pollutants. Moderate contamination is relatively widespread in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, so the subset of ecosystems with at least some processes affected could be relatively large. Pollutant influences have changed and will probably continue to change on time scales of decades. Biological exposures and dose in such ecosystems are species-specific and determined by how the species is exposed to different environmental media and the geochemistry of individual pollutants within those media. Bioaccumulation models offer significant promise for interpreting such exposures. Biological responses to pollutants need to be more directly linked to exposure and dose. At the level of the individual this might be improved by better understanding relationships between tissue concentrations of pollutants and responses to pollutants. Multi-discipline field and laboratory studies combined with advanced understanding of some basic processes have reduced the ambiguities in interpreting a few physiological/organismic responses to pollutants in nature. Recognition of pollutant-induced patterns in population responses could lead to similar advances. A rational framework for ecotoxicology is developing, but its further advance is dependent upon better integration of ecotoxicology with basic marine ecology and biology.},

@article{Schroeter1996,
abstract = {It has often been observed that the abundance of sea urchins is lower inside kelp forests and along their nearshore edges than outside their offshore boundaries. We tested the hypothesis that this distributional pattern is a reflection of settlement patterns by monitoring settlement on artificial surfaces at 3 kelp forests near San Diego, California, USA. We estimated settlement at paired sites under the canopy and outside the offshore edge of the kelp forests and at paired sites located 20 m outside the canopy near the inshore and offshore boundaries of each kelp forest. There was no evidence of an effect of dense stands of giant kelp on the settlement of purple sea urchins. The results for red sea urchins were ambiguous; in 3 of 7 comparisons, average settlement was higher or observations of higher settlement were more frequent offshore from the kelp forest than elsewhere. Although this could result from different effects on the 2 species, we think it probably was due to accidents of sampling. We conclude that the distributional patterns of purple and red sea urchins relative to kelp forests are unlikely to reflect larval availability or settlement, but are more probably a function of post-settlement events, We qualify our conclusions because of the tremendous temporal variability in the physical and biological factors that can potentially affect the local distribution of sea urchin larvae. The 2 years of this study may be short relative to natural cycles.},

Depth had a greater effect on morphology as a whole but the strongest single interaction was between water motion and blade thickness. The plant characteristics measured were analysed using discriminant analysis and the depth/site groups were well separated on the two axes of the resulting ordination with 70{\%} of the grouped cases correctly classified. The greatest separation was along function I, which correlated most strongly with blade thickness: function II correlated with stipe length, stipe length/stipe weight and frond surface area. No significant difference in attachment strength was found between plants growing in the extremes of water motion, a decrease in frond surface area in more exposed sites resulted in a decreased resistance to water motion.},

In total, 552 individual settlers were mapped and followed daily during their first 3 to 5 d after settlement in May 1992 and were then periodically re-examined over a 45 d period. A sharp decline in survivorship occurred during the first day after settlement. For settlers arriving on 16 and 17 May, mortality during the first day after settlement (38.0{\%}) was almost as high as all mortality during the following 44 d (40.1{\%}). Mortality during the first day after settlement was 1.5 to 6.0 times higher than during the second day for settlers arriving on 16, 17 and 18 May. There was no relationship, however, between percent first day mortality and densities of recruits or of grazers (limpets, littorines). The elevated levels of first day mortality were also not consistent with desiccation stress, wave exposure, or size-specific changes in vulnerability. The first moments after settlement may constitute a bottleneck for the survival of barnacles settling in the intertidal zone. For organisms such as B.glandula, selective pressures for traits such as time of settlement relative to the tidal cycle, selection of settlement micro-site, and energy reserves at settlement could be most intense during the first day in the benthic habitat.},

abstract = {Certain aspects of the foraging behavior of the Cape Rock Lobster, Jasus lalandii, were investigated to determine whether this animal selects prey or merely feeds randomly on a variety of prey items in proportion to their abundance. We also investigated the lobsters' ability to digest unusual food items, e.g., sponges and seaweeds, which are sometimes found in large quantities in their gut. The study combined field observations with analyses of gut contents and digestive enzyme activity. The results suggest that Jasus lalandii is primarily a carnivore with limited ability to digest plant tissue. Preferred foods are black and ribbed mussels (Charamytilus meridianalis and Aulacamya ater correspondingly), and a large variety of marine arthropods; activities of protease and chitinase are strong. Seaweeds are probably only incidentally caught by lobsters. They are only sporadically found in lobster guts. More- over, neither laminarinase nor alginase activity, which is essential for the digestion of plant tissue, was detected. It is possible, however, that Jasus lalandii extracts some starches from marine plants as amylase activity in their gut is strong. The most significant finding of this study is the ability of lobsters to feed on and digest sponges. This is evidenced by large quantities of sponge in certain lobster guts and strong activity of the protease gelatinase (which breaks down the sponge collagen skeleton).},

abstract = {In this review, I summarize recent developments in marine chemical ecology and suggest additional studies that should be especially productive. Direct tests in both the field and laboratory show that secondary metabohtes commonly function as defenses against consumers. However, some metabolites also diminish fouling, inhibit competitors or microbial pathogens, and serve as gamete attractants; these alternative functions are less thoroughly investigated. We know little about how consumers perceive secondary metabolites or how ecologically realistic doses of defensive metabolites affect consumer physiology or fitness, as opposed to feeding behavior. Secondary metabolites have direct consequences, but they do not act in isolation from other prey characteristics or from the physical and biological environment in which organisms interact with their natural enemies. This mandates that marine chemical ecology be better integrated into a broader and more complex framework that includes aspects of physiological, population, community, and even ecosystem ecology. Recent advances in this area involve assessing how chemically mediated interactions are affected by physical factors such as flow, desiccation, UV radiation, and nutrient availability, or by biological forces such as the palatability or defenses of neighbors, fouling organisms, or microbial symbionts. Chemical defenses can vary dramatically among geographic regions, habitats, individuals within a local habitat, and within different portions of the same individual. Factors affecting this variance are poorly known, but include physical stresses and induction due to previous attack. Studies are needed to assess which consumers induce prey defenses, how responses vary in environments with differing physical characteristics, and whether the induced responses are a direct response to consumer attack or are a defense against microbial pathogens invading via feeding wounds. Although relatively unstudied, ontogenetic shifts in concentrations and types of defenses occur in marine species, and patterns of larval chemical defenses appear to provide insights into the evolution of complex life cycles and of differing modes of development among marine invertebrates. The chemical ecology of marine microbes is vastly underappreciated even though microbes produce metabohtes that can have devastating indirect effects on non-target organisms (e.g., red tide related fish kills) and significantly affect entire ecosystems. The natural functions of these metabolites are poorly understood, but they appear to deter both consumers and other microbes. Additionally, marine macro-organisms use metabolites from microbial symbionts to deter consumers, subdue prey, and defend their embryos from pathogens. Microbial chemical ecology offers unlimited},

abstract = {Evidence for long-term natural change in coastal ecosystems has to be separated from the effects of intense anthropogenic impacts, especially in heavily populated areas. The kelp forests of southern California, highly productive ecosystems organized around the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, support a variety of fisheries, and the kelp is harvested for extraction of alginates. Because of the importance of Macrocystis itself to the diverse assemblage within the kelp forest community, research in this ecosystem has focused on changes in giant kelp populations. Canopy maps of the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego illustrate major changes over the last century; these changes have been ascribed to a variety of different causes, including temperature. To understand the role of physical forcing on interannual variability in the Macrocystis canopy at Point Loma, we compared two 31-year kelp data sets with available physical records. Annual average surface temperature was significantly correlated with kelp harvest, but explained only 24{\%} of the variance. Because the canopy of giant kelp is susceptible to disturbances that may not affect plant survival, we evaluated two subsurface measures-stipe number as an index of individual plant growth, and stipe density as a measure of carrying capacity. Both stipe measures were sensitive to interannual variability in surface temperature for the period 1983-95 and were more sensitive than plant survival. Plant size and carrying capacity were very low following 1992-93 El Nino conditions and the anomalously warm 1994. Comparison with historical stipe data from 1957, 1973, and 1974 indicates up to two-thirds reductions in standing biomass since 1957. There is a strong inverse trend between median plant size and the sums of anomalies in Scripps Institution of Oceanography Pier surface temperature, calculated quarterly for three years. It appears, however, that these large, interdecadal changes in biomass can be explained by the location of the data sets within multiyear warm and cold periods. We conclude that stipe numbers and stipe density-measures of individual plant size and carrying capacity-are useful tools for evaluating long-term change in Macrocystis populations within specific locations. Although limited by the paucity of historical observations, the sensitivity of stipe counts to surface temperature argues strongly for their incorporation into ongoing and future kelp forest research.},

Although the photo- inhibition effects were partly attributable to protective mechanisms, a concurrent increase in minimal fluores- cence (Fo) indicated damage to Photosystem II reaction centers. The magnitude of photoinhibition was propor- tional to irradiance and duration; however, Fv/Fm was significantly reduced after exposure to irradiances as low as 40 to 50 gmol photons m-Zs- 1 for 1 h, or to 700 gmol photons m- 2s- {\~{}} for only 5 rain. In contrast, photosynthetic capacity (P .... ) was affected only at much higher irradiance. Superoptimal temperatures up to 24 {\~{}} did not exacerbate high-light effects. At 25 {\~{}} however, alpha and Pmax were more susceptible to photoinhibition than at lower temperatures. Recovery from photoinhibition was examined by following Fv/Fm and Fo for 24 h after exposure to high light. Recovery of F{\~{}}/F m was fastest during the first 1 to 3 h, and slowed or ceased after 6 to 12 h, while recovery of Fo was relatively constant over 12h. Dithiothreitol, which blocks formation of energy-dissipating xanthophylls, reduced both the initial rate and extent of recovery. Chloramphenicol, which blocks chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis, had little effect on initial rates of recovery, but stopped recovery after 3 h. Thus, L. sac- charina appears to rely on the xanthophyll cycle to protect the photosynthetic apparatus, and reversal of this protective mechanism causes the rapid initial re- covery in Fv/Fm. Longterm recovery depends on repair of damaged reaction centers. Both the rate and extent of recovery were temperature-dependent. The initial rate was higher at 18 to 22 {\~{}} than at 12 {\~{}} but the extent of recovery over 24 h declined with increasing temperature. High temperatures, therefore, appear to enhance protective mechanisms, but disrupt repair pro- cesses. L. saccharina from Long Island Sound, an eco- type adapted to low light and high temperature, showed slightly but consistently greater effects of photoinhibition than plants from the Atlantic coast of Maine, but exhibited faster recovery at superoptimal temperatures.},

abstract = {Reproduction is closely tied to environmental conditions and the availability of resources, and thus typically varies with season. Consequently, perennial organisms that reproduce continuously are generally restricted to tropical regions with relatively aseasonal climates. The temperate marine alga Macrocystis pyrifera is a rare exception in this regard, as most individuals reproduce throughout the year in a seasonally variable habitat. Here we measure reproductive responses of the giant kelp Macrocystis during a period in which resources and environmental conditions fluctuated greatly and contrast these responses with those of the palm kelp, Pterygophora californica, a sympatric species that exhibits strictly seasonal reproduction. The quantity and quality of spore production tracked resource availability within and among years for Macrocystis, but not for Pterygophora. Reproductive allocation and spore standing stock in Macrocystis were negatively correlated with seawater temperature and positively correlated with the nitrogen content of adult plants. Macrocystis generally dis- played two seasonally distinct peaks in spore production per year (winter and spring). The only disruption of this pattern coincided with a warmwater El Ninio event. Although seawater temperature and the nitrogen content of adults were inversely related in Pterygophora, neither variable was significantly correlated with the quantity or quality of spore production in this species. Unlike Macrocystis, Pterygophora exhibited a well-defined reproductive season in which plants displayed a single broad peak in spore production that varied little in timing and magnitude among years, even during El Nifio conditions. Spore C/N ratios remained relatively constant over time in both species, despite large seasonal fluctuations in C/N ratios of vegetative tissue of adults plants. Nonetheless, spore C/N ratios were positively correlated with seawater temperature in Macrocystis, but not in Pterygophora. Spore viability (swimming and germination) varied considerably, and often unpredictably, over time for both species. Our results support the general idea that environmental conditions and resources exert a much greater influence on the quantity and quality of reproduction in species that reproduce continuously than on the majority of species that are strictly seasonal in onset of repro- duction. The differential responses of Macrocystis and Pterygophora may reflect their different morphologies and life-spans. Macrocystis is relatively short lived and may "hedge its bets" by reproducing continuously rather than risk delaying reproduction. Conversely, since Pterygophora lives much longer, plants can afford to release spores only during times when the chances for reproductive success are predictably greatest because these plants are likely to reproduce again in subsequent years.

abstract = {The high marine species diversity in the Indo-West Pacific declines sharply to the cast and west of the Indonesian Archipelago. This biogeographic pattern has attracted attention for over a century, but the mechanisms generating such diversity gradients remain uncertain. Molecular genetic data can help address biogeographic mechanisms in at least 4 ways. They can provide (1) independent evidence for genetic boundaries between cryptic species, (2) a temporal framework for species divergence times, (3) phylogenetic reconstructions of species divergence patterns, and (4) information about the geography of allelic variants within species. Data from mitochondrial DNA variation in Pacific sea urchins show that (1) congeneric species are of recent origin, having diverged within the Pleistocene, (2) populations are genetically heterogeneous despite high dispersal potential, and (3) clines of mtDNA variation within species are similar to diversity clines in the entire fauna. Phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA variants does not support the center-of-overlap or center-of-accumulation models for biogeographic patterns in the Indo-West Pacific, but instead suggests that genetic differentiation and perhaps species formation can occur throughout the Indo-West Pacific.},

abstract = {In this study we explored the trophic relationships between intertidal and subtidal ecosystems of a rocky-shore community. We selected the most abundant intertidal primary consumers, principally invertebrate grazers and filter-feeders, and investigated their trophic connections with in situ intertidal production (internal) and/or subtidal kelp production (external). Using two stable isotopes (nitrogen and carbon), we examined the degree to which filter feeders depend trophically on kelp detritus or pelagic phytoplankton, and to which intertidal grazers depend on subtidal kelps or intertidal micro- and macroalgae. The filter-feeders used kelp-derived detritus as their main source of organic carbon and nitrogen. Similarly, two abundant and highly specialized grazers also used subtidal kelps as their main source of carbon and nitrogen, although other more generalized intertidal grazers relied mainly on the in situ epilithic algal production. We determined the extent to which kelp detritus contributes to the total particulate organic matter (POM) on exposed and sheltered habitats during different tidal phases. Kelp-derived detritus represented more than 65{\%} of POM, being consistently high all year round and during both high and low tides, but was particularly high on exposed shores. Phytoplankton was seldom found and contributed no more than 6{\%} of total intertidal POM. We conclude that kelp-derived detritus represents a steady source of food for filter- feeders, upon which they can rely all year round. A short-term experiment revealed that the water turnover on exposed shores was about seven times greater than on sheltered shores; the consequent increase in the supply of food may explain why filter-feeder biomass is high on wave exposed shores. Finally, a simple steady-state model was built to simulate mussel standing stock (biomass per unit area) as a function of food supply and water turnover. The model predicts significantly lower mussel standing stock on sheltered than exposed shores. We conclude that replenishment of food by wave action is sufficient to explain the observed differences of filter feeder biomass between exposed and sheltered shores. It is also concluded that subtidal macrophyte production greatly influences the structure of intertidal rocky-shore communities on the west coast of South Africa.},

Predicted maximal tensions are close to those measured in the field. The strength of Macrocystis pyrifera stipes was measured, allowing our prediction of forces to be translated into a prediction of the fraction of stipes broken. Predicted breakage is low even for extreme storm waves, a testament to the mechanical design of individual kelp fronds. However, empirically measured rates of kelp mortality can be high, considerably higher than those predicted on the basis of hydrodynamic forces acting alone. This indicates that factors not taken into account in our model (such as holdfast dislodgment, entanglement of stipes, damage from herbivory and wave breaking) contribute substantially to mortality in Macrocystis pyrifera.},

Due to the morphology of the Chilean coast, we divided our analysis in two large zones. In northern Chile, between 18 degrees-42 degrees S, the Cordillera de la Costa runs close to the coast generating extremely exposed habitats. In this zone two species of Lessonia are dominant in intertidal and subtidal habitats. Here, the sea urchin Tetrapygus niger is the most abundant grazer producing extensive intertidal and subtidal barren grounds. South of 42 degrees S to Cape Horn, Macrocystis pyrifera forms the most conspicuous kelp association in a fjord zone, where hundreds of islands produce protected habitats. Four species of sea urchins and the gastropod Tegula atra graze on M. pyrifera. However, their effects are spatially and temporary restricted. The foraging behavior of the principal herbivore, the sea urchin Loxechinus albus, is influenced by the degree of wave action, restricting its effect to exposed areas, In very protected areas Tegula atra affects the population dynamics of M. pyrifera.},

Recreational catch information, based on permit sales only, are presented for the 1995/96 fishing season. Permit sales increased by 30{\%} from 1991/92 to 1995/96, with a marked increase in 1992/93. The majority of the recreational permit holders were males (80{\%}) between the ages of 25 and 49 years (68{\%}), who were resident in areas close to the resource. Most of the permit holders (74{\%}) fished throughout the season (as opposed to holidays only), mainly (70{\%}) over weekends. Diving and the use of hoopnets from powered boats were the most popular methods of capture, with shore-based methods and the use of hoopnets from rowing boats of lesser importance. The bulk of the recreational catch was landed within the first three months of the start of the season (by the end of January), which was consistent with the trend in permit sales. The total recreational catch of rock lobster increased from 159 tons in 1991/92 to 469 tons in 1992/93, probably because of an increase in the length of the season and a decrease in the minimum legal size limit, and was estimated at 379 tons for the 1995/96 season. The total recreational catch, as a percentage of the commercial Total Allowable Catch, increased from 7{\%} in 1991/92 to 21{\%} in the 1992/93 season and was estimated at 25{\%} in 1995/96$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Abiotic and biotic factors determining the upper (shallow or nearshore) limit of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera Agardh, were examined along a wave exposure gradient on the Monterey Peninsula, central California, USA. Wave modeling, analysis of aerial photographs from 1986 to 1989 and SCUBA surveys from 1993 to 1995 indicated a significant positive relationship between wave intensity and depth of the upper limit of giant kelp; increased wave intensity resulted in the upper limit moving offshore into deeper water presumably due to direct removal of adult giant kelp plants by waves. Further, during periods of high wave intensity, plants with canopies were restricted to deeper water than those without canopies, suggesting that wave- induced giant kelp mortality was related to plant biomass (i.e. drag). Removal of giant kelp from shallow water (??? 2.5 m depth) during periods of high wave intensity may have facilitated the development of dense algal turf assemblages by reducing light limitation; clearing experiments indicated that algal turf inhibited giant kelp recruitment at depths ??? 2.5 m. Under extended periods of low wave intensity, however, giant kelp can establish populations in shallow water as indicated by the shallower depth of continuous giant kelp canopies with decreasing wave exposure. Thus, algal community structure in these shallow subtidal regions along the Monterey Peninsula appears to be determined by disturbance-mediated competition; with a lack of disturbance favoring giant kelp, disturbance favoring algal turf. These data support the hypothesis that the upper limit of giant kelp is controlled by an interaction between abiotic and biotic factors.},

abstract = {A mathematical model to simulate the population dynamics and productivity of macroalgae is described. The model calculates the biomass variation of a population divided into size-classes. Biomass variation in each class is estimated from the mass balance of carbon fixation, carbon release and demographic processes such as mortality and frond breakage. The transitions between the different classes are calculated in biomass and density units as a function of algal growth. Growth is computed from biomass variations using an allometric relationship between weight and length. Gross and net primary productivity is calculated from biomass production and losses over the period of simulation. The model allows the simulation of different harvesting strategies of commercially important species. The cutting size and harvesting period may be changed in order to optimise the calculated yields. The model was used with the agarophyte Gelidium sesquipedale (Clem.) Born. et Thur. This species was chosen because of its economic importance as a the main raw material for the agar industry. Net primary productivity calculated with it and from biomass variations over a yearly period, gave similar results. The results obtained suggest that biomass dynamics and productivity are more sensitive to the light extinction coefficient than to the initial biomass conditions for the model. Model results also suggest that biomass losses due to respiration and exudation are comparable to those resulting from mortality and frond breakage. During winter, a significant part of the simulated population has a negative net productivity. The importance of considering different parameters in the productivity light relationships in order to account for their seasonal variability is demonstrated with the model results. The model was implemented following an object oriented programming approach. The programming methodology allows a fast adaptation of the model to other species without major software development.},

abstract = {Wave action on exposed rocky coasts can be severe, generating large hydrodynamic forces that have been proposed to constrain the size of intertidal animals and plants. In contrast, flows subtidally are more benign, and organisms, particularly seaweeds, may grow quite large. The large dimensions of these flexible macroalgae allow them to move during much or most of a passing wave cycle, reducing relative water velocities and modifying the forces the plants must endure. The consequences of such wave-induced motion are explored for the stipitate understory kelps Eisenia arborea and Pterygophora californica using a numerical model that approximates these seaweeds as vertically oriented cantilever beams subjected to lateral hydrodynamic forces acting at their stipe tips. Bending moments and peak stresses induced in the stipes of these species during the passage of waves are calculated as functions of plant size and shape and of water depth and sea state. Model predictions for a subset of conditions are validated against real-time measurements of bending moments acting on a Pterygophora individual in the field. The results suggest that the allometric patterns of growth exhibited by Eisenia and Pterygophora can greatly reduce the stresses generated in the stipes of these plants relative to isometric growth. Low stipe stiffness acts as a general, particularly effective, stress-lowering mechanism. The dynamic swaying associated with this low stiffness can also modulate the magnitudes of peak stresses induced in the stipes of these kelps. In particular, in shallow water under large waves, dynamic loading can substantially increase induced stress, suggesting that plant motion is an important factor affecting the loading regime encountered by these organisms.},

Cross-shore velocity fluctuations are more important for the movement of material between offshore waters and the kelp bed interior.

It sets the scene with sections on industries that utilise macro-algae and seagrasses, the ecology of littoral and nearshore sublittoral ecosystems and the processes of deposition of beach-cast macro-algae and seagrasses on beaches. It then describes the major economic macro-algae and seagrasses that occur as beach-cast wrack, with an emphasis on known information on habitat distribution, geographical range, and harvesting issues. Gaps in scientific knowledge are pointed out. The priority areas of future research were found to be: The importance of beach accumulations of macro-algae and seagrasses on feeding and nesting shorebirds; Whether available resource allows for ecologically and economically sustainable harvesting; A survey of present and potential commercial macro-algae and seagrasses: studying biomass, density and annual production rates, interannual variability of recruitment into living stands, the effect of harvesting on trophodynamics and community structure and the stability of the resource base for economically sustainable harvesting; An assessment of the importance of wrack in recycling nutrients and detritus to nearshore coastal ecosystems at wider geographical scales than previous work.

Here we compare the fates of the 2 post- disturbance algal communities, or '2 cohorts', under condltions determined by large-scale, low- frequency oceanographic events. Succession and population dynamics of the competitive dom{\~{}}nant kelp. Macrocystis pyrifera, and understory kelps, Pterygophora californlca and Laminaria farlowu, were followed at 5 permanent sites in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego. California, USA. where kelps have been mapped quarterly since 1983. There was intense kelp recruitment after both disturbances. The different oceanographic cond{\~{}}tions, however, strongly affected the population competitive interactions with the lower standing species. Poor M dynamlcs of M. pynfera and {\~{}}ts pyrifera growth, canopy formation, and survival during the El Nino apparently allowed the persistence of understory populations. Extraordinary conditions for M. pyrifera growth during the La Niria were associated with the near extinction of understory populations. The number of stipes per plant and stipe dens{\~{}}ty are indices of IM, pyr{\~{}}fera growth and carrying capacity, respect{\~{}}vely, which appear to be very senslt{\~{}}ve to environmental condltions. The 2 cohorts exh{\~{}}blted very different stipe patterns. In both cases, the anomalous oceanographic conditions lasted for about 2 yr after the disturbances, but the effects on kelp community structure persisted for the lives of the M. pyrifera cohorts, despite average or relatively poor conditions later In summary, these data suggest that large-scale, low-frequency oceanographic phenomena are important to kelp forest successional processes, population dynamics, and competitive interactions among kelp guilds KEY},

abstract = {Mechanisms of high-temperature tolerance in the kelp Laminaria saccharina (L.) Lamour, were examined by comparing a heat-tolerant ecotype from Long Island Sound (LIS), New York, and a population from the Atlantic (ATL) coast of Maine. Greater heat tolerance was not attributable to greater thermal stability of the photosynthetic apparatus: LIS and ATL plants exhibited similar short-term effects of high temperature on photosynthetic capacity (P-max) and quantum yield (estimated as the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence, F-v/F-m). As LIS plants had consistently higher N and protein content than ATL plants, the interaction between nitrogen nutrition and high-temperature tolerance was examined. When grown under high N supply and optimal temperature (12 degrees C), LIS plants had a higher density of photosystem II reaction centers (RCII), higher activity of two Calvin cycle enzymes (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase [RUBISCO] and NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [G3PDH]), and higher P-max and F-v/F-m than ATL plants. Individual ATL plants, furthermore, exhibited close correlations of RCII density and enzyme activity with N and/or protein content. Variation in RCII density and enzyme activity, in turn, largely accounted for plant-to-plant differences in P-max and F-v/F-m. Relationships among these parameters were generally weak or lacking among individual LIS plants grown under optimal conditions, apparently because luxury N consumption resulted in excess reserves of photosynthetic apparatus components. Exposure of N-replete LIS and ATL plants to a superoptimal temperature (22 degrees C) for 4 days caused an increase in the minimum turnover time of the photosynthetic apparatus (tau) and a decrease in P-max, but had no consistent effect on F-v/F-m, RCII density, PSU size (chlorophyll a/RCII), or enzyme activities. When plants were subjected to concurrent N limitation and heat stress, however, LIS and ATL populations exhibited quite different responses. All photosynthetic parameters of N-limited ATL plants declined sharply in response to high temperature, resulting in a negative rate of daily net C fixation. In contrast, LIS plants showed a reduction in PSU size, but maintained other parameters, including daily C fixation, at levels similar to those of N-limited plants at optimal temperature. Overall, the ability of LIS plants to accumulate and maintain high N reserves appears to be critical for heat tolerance and, therefore, for survival during summer periods of simultaneous low N supply and superoptimal temperature. ATL plants, which also experience low summer N supply but not superoptimal temperatures, do not accumulate large reserves of nitrogenous components and are unable to tolerate the combined stress. Because low N supply often co-occurs with high temperatures in temperature marine systems, large-scale declines in algal productivity, such as during El Nino events, are probably due to the interactive effect of N limitation and heat stress.},

abstract = {We examined factors affecting the abundance and distribution of epiphytes (fouling) on the sublittoral kelp Ecklonia radiata. We {\textregistered}rst assessed the importance of phlorotannins as chemical defences against epiphytes by (a) correlating epiphyte loads on different parts of the thallus with the phlorotannin content of those tissues, and (b) experimentally testing the effects of variation in phlorotannin concentration against the settlement and growth of gametes of Ulva lactuca, a common epiphyte in the system. Tissue phlorotannin content was, at best, only weakly related to epiphyte loads, with r2 values typically {\textless}0.10. Inhibition of Ulva gametes only occurred at concentrations {\textgreater}10 mg l)1, which is 5 orders of magnitude greater than levels of phlorotannins in the water column around beds of E. radiata, and 1±3 orders of magnitude greater than estimated levels in the boundary layer at the surface of the plant. We concluded that phlorotannins have a negligible impact on patterns of epiphytism on E. radiata, and proceeded to investigate other factors in¯uencing the distribution and abundance of epiphytes. In our samples the relative age of different parts of the thallus was strongly correlated with epiphyte abundance, with epiphyte densities greatest on the oldest tissue and least on the youngest. Distal parts of the thalli also had greater epiphyte loads than basal parts. Field experiments in which kelp tissue was suspended at two heights in an E. radiata forest for varying lengths of time con{\textregistered}rmed the importance of the length of time that the tissue was in the water, and its height in the water column, to the development of an epiphyte community. Comparison of epiphyte loads on tissue from primary (smooth) and secondary (rough) laminae in these experiments indicated that surface rugosity also affected fouling. Macroherbivores were rare on E. radiata, and abundances of mesofauna andepiphytes were positively related, suggesting that grazers were not important determinants of patterns of epiphyte abundance. Although phlorotannins have been previously suggested to play an important role as defences against epiphytes, we suggest that water-soluble compounds such as phlorotannins are less likely to be effective defences against epiphytes than non-polar metabolites, which can adhere to the surface of the producing organism.},

Global discharge of riverine DOC is sufficient alone to sustain turnover of the entire pool of organic carbon dissolved in seawater. Similarly, the input of terrestrial POC by rivers is adequate to supply all the organic carbon buried in marine sediments. Because riverine organic matter consists of highly degraded, nitrogen-poor remains of terrestrial organisms, it might be expected to suffer minimal respiration in the ocean. One of the biggest mysteries in the global carbon cycle, therefore, is that only a small fraction of the organic matter dissolved in seawater and preserved in marine sediments appears to be land-derived. Either our global budgets and distribution estimates are greatly in error, or both dissolved and particulate organic matter of terrestrial origin suffer rapid and remarkably extensive remineralization at sea. Although many uncertainties remain, recent studies provide growing evidence for destruction of both dissolved and particulate terrestrial organic matter in the ocean. The mechanisms by which these huge masses of organic materials might be so rapidly oxidized following discharge are largely unknown. This report focuses on the transport and transformations of land-derived organic matter in the ocean, highlighting recent research one the patterns and processes involved.},

Due to the morphology of the Chilean coast, we divided our analysis in two large zones. In northern Chile, between 18 degrees-42 degrees S, the Cordillera de la Costa runs close to the coast generating extremely exposed habitats. In this zone two species of Lessonia are dominant in intertidal and subtidal habitats. Here, the sea urchin Tetrapygus niger is the most abundant grazer producing extensive intertidal and subtidal barren grounds. South of 42 degrees S to Cape Horn, Macrocystis pyrifera forms the most conspicuous kelp association in a fjord zone, where hundreds of islands produce protected habitats. Four species of sea urchins and the gastropod Tegula atra graze on M. pyrifera. However, their effects are spatially and temporary restricted. The foraging behavior of the principal herbivore, the sea urchin Loxechinus albus, is influenced by the degree of wave action, restricting its effect to exposed areas, In very protected areas Tegula atra affects the population dynamics of M. pyrifera.},

abstract = {The distribution of young sporophytes (up to 0.25 m stipe length) of the kelp Ecklonia maxima, on various substrata, at depths of 2.5 to 5.0 m, was studied at 8 sites on the southwest coast of South Africa. The most common substratum available was rock (bare or covered with encrusting coralline algae), followed by kelp holdfasts, and the ascidian Pyura stolonifera at some sites. A disproportionately high ratio (relative to the available substrata) of young sporophytes grew on the holdfasts of mature kelps at most sites, but particularly where high densities of benthic invertebrate grazers were present (mainly the urchin Parechinus angulosus, also abalone Haliotis midae, limpets Patella spp, and gastropods Turbo spp, and Oxystele spp.). Jacobs' index of electivity was used an indicator of 'preference for' (interpreted as indicating survival on) the substratum type. This showed a statistically significant 'negative selection' of rock as a substratum at sites where grazers were numerous. The ratios of young sporophytes on holdfasts/young sporophytes on rock were directly proportional to grazer densities when sites were compared (r = -0.90, p = 0.002); supporting the hypothesis that mature holdfasts are an important refuge for recruitment of E. maxima sporophytes. There was an inverse relationship between percentage cover of understorey algae and grazer densities (r = 0.92, p = 0.001). In general, sites east of Cape Point (west coast/south coast transition zone) have far more grazers and reduced understorey algal biomasses compared to west coast sites.

abstract = {Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys were conducted over a 3-year period to evaluate the importance of macroalgal drift exported from nearshore forests of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) to adjacent submarine-canyon and continental-shelf benthic habitats. Abundant macroalgal drift was found in the Carmel Submarine Canyon (153454-m depth) but was rare at Pt. Joe, a continental shelf habitat 9 km away (87-357-m depth). Most of the drift parcels consisted of brown algae, but 10 other categories were found, including green and red algae and the surfgrass Phyllospadix spp. M. pyrifera drift accounted for as much as 20{\%} of the density of drift parcels in the Carmel Submarine Canyon, and up to 50{\%} of the drift parcels at Pt. Joe. From previously determined turnover rates of drift M. pyrifera and the standing stock estimates from the present study, we estimated that the rate of carbon flux associated with drift M. pyrifera to the benthos of the Carmel Submarine Canyon was 45.2 mg C m-2 d-1. Based on published estimates of carbon flux from vertically sinking particulate organic carbon at 400-m depth in the nearby Monterey Submarine Canyon, and our estimates of kelp-derived carbon flux, drift M. pyrifera can account for 20-83{\%} of the total particulate organic carbon reaching the sea floor in the Carmel Submarine Canyon. We conclude that drift macrophytes provide significant enrichment of organic carbon to the benthos above that provided by vertically sinking particulate organic material. The extent to which this alters the structure of benthic communities compared to areas without organic enrichment by drift macrophytes remains unknown and awaits further study.},
annote = {{\textgreater} In the submarine canyon in this study, it was found that macroalgal drift provided a predictable source of nutrition for A. fragilis, which allowed a higher reproductive condition than conspecifics at the nearby shelf habitat where drift macrophytes provided significant enrichment of organic carbon to the benthos above that provided by the vertical flux associated with detrital rain. 

{\textgreater} Thus , laterally transported macroalgal drift nearshore kelp forests may play a more important role in the flux of organic carbon to deep-sea environments than previously recognised. This may partially explain the descrepancy between carbon flux and carbon demand of the benthos recently reported for the continental margin deep-sea habitats. Carbon flux estimates from particle traps do not account for laterally advected macroalagal drift, which may be a quantitatively important process in coastal habitats.},

abstract = {The 'Eastern Pacific Barrier' (EPB), 5400 km of uninterrupted deep water between the central and eastern Pacific, constitutes the greatest marine obstacle to the dispersal of shallow-water organisms. However, some species are found on both sides of the EPB. These 'transpacific' species are considered by 'dispersal' biogeographers as evidence of invasions through the barrier. 'Vicariance' biogeographers, on the other hand, think that transpacific species are morphologically conservative remnants of previously continuous distributions. We compared nucleotide sequences in a 642 bp region of mitochondrial DNA, and electrophoretically detected alleles in 17 enzymatic loci of central and eastern Pacific populations of Echinothrix diadema, an Indo-Pacific sea urchin recently reported from the eastern Pacific. Both types of molecules produced clear evidence of massive, recent gene flow across the EPB. Thus, rather than being isolated relicts of Tethyan distributions, conspecific populations from the eastern and central Pacific are genetically connected. Though the EPB is biogeographically important as a cause of speciation in many groups, it allows genetic connections in others, possibly through larval transport during El Ni{\~{n}}o events.},

The secondary metabolites dictyol E and pachydictyol A are among the compounds found on this alga's surface. In the present study, we tested the effects of specific diterpenes from Dictyota on the survivorship, growth, and development of invertebrate larvae and developing juveniles that could foul seaweeds. Exposure to dictyol E, dictyol B acetate, pachydictyol A, and dictyodial from Dictyota menstrualis and D. ciliolata caused significant larval mortality, abnormal development, and reduce growth rates for three species of co-occurring invertebrates when their larvae were forced into contact with these metabolites. Larvae were damaged at metabolite concentrations as low as 5{\%} of maximum possible surface concentrations of these compounds for the populations of Dictyota we studied. The negative effects of these secondary metabolites on potential foulers, in conjunction with data demonstrating larval avoidance of dictyol-covered surfaces, suggest that these compounds could function as chemical defenses against fouling, and could select for larvae that avoid hosts producing these metabolites.},

abstract = {All species have evolved in the presence of distur- bance, and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Conse- quently, disturbances within the typical range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturba- tions within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physi- cally based disturbance (for example, storm, volca- nic eruption, and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their interactions. Dis- persal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that de- scribe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations, either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery, and appear to have entered new domains or ‘‘ecological surprises.'' In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state.We argue that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthro- pogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common. Understanding these ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental management decisions of the 21st century. Key},

Five samples were collected in each of four depth zones (0-5, 6-10, 11-15 and 16-20 m). The area from which fish were collected in each sample was measured to give an estimate of density. The overall density of cryptic fishes in the area was 3.41 fish m-2, with the families Congrogadidae and Clinidae being numerically dominant, representing 27.9{\%} and 22.3{\%} of the total sample respectively. The Clinidae were by far the most diverse group, being represented by 17 species, while no other family was represented by more than three species. Multivariate analysis of numerical density revealed that partitioning of spatial resources did occur, with the shallowest samples (0-5 m) forming a group discrete from the deeper samples (6-20 m). Further analysis indicated that the amount of algal cover present was the most important factor influencing community structure, although the abundance of algae is in turn related to depth. The shallowest samples were dominated by members of the families Clinidae, Gobiesocidae and Bythitidae, while the Cheilodactylidae, Tripterygiidae and Ariidae were more important components of deeper water communities (6-20 m). Analysis of percentage volume of prey items in the diets of 21species revealed that only two species shared diets that were more than 50{\%} similar, and that partitioning of trophic resources was considerable.},

abstract = {Experiments in a central California Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.A. Agardh forest examined the effects of long-term (six year) kelp canopy exclusion on the abundance of the annual brown alga Desmarestia ligulata (Light F). Exclusion of both surface and subsurface kelp canopies from replicate clearings within stillwater Cove, CA, USA showed that D. ligulata sporophyte recruitment is opportunistic, with more sporophytes occurring in areas where canopies were excluded than under control canopies. Kelp canopy exclusion also increased spring and summer bottom irradiances, and resulted in a steady increase of perennial turf algae over the six-year study. This, in turn, led to a decrease in the availability of nongeniculate coralline algae (the primary substratum on which D. ligulata recruits). Subsequently, the annual maximum abundance of D. ligulata sporophytes decreased in the Canopy clearings, but did not change under control canopies. Removal of turf algae from experimental plots further increased bottom irradiances and significantly enhanced D. ligulata recruitment. When released from apparent competition for light and space, D. ligulata sporophytes exhibited an annual life history, with recruitment occurring during a two-week period (April 4- April 17) in the spring, and maximum bottom cover occurring in the summer (July). The onset of Desmarestia sporophyte recruitment was closely associated with seasonal increases in daylength and rapid decreases in ocean temperature. These results indicate that the Desmarestia sporophyte life history is both annual and opportunistic, with the onset of recruitment stimulated by predictable, seasonal changes in environmental conditions, and the magnitude of recruitment modified by stochastic processes that affect the availability of light and space. Comparison of these results with those from similar studies indicate that they are robust and suggest that they may be generalized over broad temporal and spatial scales.},

abstract = {Phlorotannins are polyphenolic brown algal secondary metabolites that can function as herbivore deterrents, digestive inhibitors, and antibacterial agents; thus, they are putative defensive agents against the natural enemies of these algae. Focusing on phlorotannin chemical characteristics alone is not sufficient to explain their activity over a broad geographical range. In particular, it appears that: 1. polyphenolics act with more specificity of activity than initially suggested. 2. the reactivity of polyphenolics is affected by the chemical environment of a herbivore's gut. 3. spatial and temporal variability within a given locality in various environmental parameters (nutrients, irradiance, intensity of herbivory) affects polyphenolic levels. The interaction of these factors has confounded our ability to accurately predict the antiherbivore activity of phlorotannins in plant-herbivore interactions, particularly in the tropical oceans. We assess here the current status of our knowledge of these interactions by reviewing and integrating our understanding of phlorotannin chemical characteristics, function, variability, and potential cost in both temperate and tropical marine systems.

abstract = {In the mid-1800s, the agricultural chemist Justus von Liebig demonstrated strong positive relationships between soil nutrient supplies and the growth yields of terrestrial plants, and it has since been found that freshwater and marine plants are equally responsive to nutrient inputs. Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the Earth's surface and atmosphere have increased greatly during the past two centuries. This nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication, can lead to highly undesirable changes in ecosystem structure and function, however. In this paper we briefly review the process, the impacts, and the potential management of cultural eutrophication in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. We present two brief case studies (one freshwater and one marine) demonstrating that nutrient loading restriction is the essential cornerstone of aquatic eutrophication control. In addition, we present results of a preliminary statistical analysis that is consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic emissions of oxidized nitrogen could be influencing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide via nitrogen stimulation of global primary production.},

abstract = {In many marine species, high levels of gene flow ensure that the genetic signal from population differentiation is weak. As a consequence, various errors associ- ated with estimating population genetic parameters that might normally be safely ignored assume a relatively greater importance. This fact has important implica- tions for the use of genetic data to address two common questions in fishery con- servation and management: (1) How many stocks of a given species are there? and (2) How much gene flow occurs among stocks? This article discusses strategies to maximize the signal:noise ratio in genetic studies of marine species and sug- gests a quantitative method to correct for bias due to a common sampling problem. For many marine species, however, genetic methods alone cannot fully resolve these key management questions because the amount of migration necessary to eliminate most genetic evidence of stock structure (only a handful of individuals per generation) will generally be inconsequential as a force for rebuilding depleted populations on a time scale of interest to humans. These limitations emphasize the importance of understanding the biology and life history of the target species— first, to guide design of the sampling program, and second, so that additional in- formation can be used to supplement indirect estimates of migration rates based on genetic data.},

Two sets of 4 traps were tested, over a period of 3 d, in 2 exposed rocky shores in central Chile. The RIPTs collected a total of 21 major plankton taxa ranging in size from 100 mu m (bivalve larvae) to 2700 mu m (Isopoda). The cumulative number of planktonic organisms collected per trap ranged between 123 and 215. Cylinders of dentist chalk attached inside and outside the RIPTs and specially designed RIPT-flowmeters permitted an evaluation of water flux and an approximation of the rate of water filtering through the RIPTs. Maximum water velocities on the intertidal platforms were determined with the use of an intertidal dynamometer.},

abstract = {Species composition reflects a combination of environmental and historical events at a site; hence, changes in species composition can provide a sensitive measure of ecologically relevant changes in the environment. Here, we consider the analysis of species composition when multiple sites are followed through time. Analyses of temporal trends in species composition either summarize species composition into a few metrics (indices or axis scores) or analyze the similarity among sites. We develop and illustrate the similarity approach. Each pair of samples represents a pair of replicates, a pair from the same site at different times, a pair from different sites at the same time, or an unrelated pair. Differences among times can be estimated by comparing average temporal dissimilarity to average replicate dissimilarity. Temporal trends can be described by one of three statistics that measure progressive change, the correlation of temporal dissimilarity with the length of time between samples. These methods are illustrated using data on changes in a South Carolina zooplankton assemblage following disturbance, and changes in bird species composition on Skokholm Island, Wales. It is difficult to define and interpret temporal trends. Some definitions of interesting trends, like increasing divergence from another set of sample plots, place additional requirements on the sampling design. Including replicate samples or clustering sample plots and including "control" plots for comparison with sentinel sites would contribute to an understanding of changes in species composition.},

abstract = {The detection of trends in ecosystems depends upon (1) a good description of the foundation or benchmark against which changes are measured and (2) a distinction between natural and anthropogenic changes. Patterns and mechanisms observed over 25 years in a large kelp forest suggest that definition of a meaningful benchmark is impossible, because many of the large animals have been gone for years to decades, and kelps are sensitive to large-scale, low-frequency El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation events and longer term regime shifts. A shift in the oceanographic climate has significantly reduced the average size and carrying capacity of the dominant plant. The animals that have been functionally removed from the community include sea otters, black sea bass, yellowtail, white sea bass, and abalones. Other species are still present, but fisheries have had huge effects on the abundances, size–frequencies, and/or spatial distributions of sheephead, kelp bass, rays, flatfish, rock fish, spiny lobsters, and red sea urchins. Now even sea cucumbers, crabs, and small snails are subject to unregulated fishing. The plants continue to exist without a hint of the effects of the loss of so much animal biomass. Furthermore, most of the megafauna have been removed with very little documentation or historical understanding of what the natural community was like. Thus, our ability to separate anthropogenic impacts from the “natural” dynamics of the system is severely compromised. We discuss the importance of both an ecosystem focus on productivity and careful monitoring of as many populations as possible. In addition, we show that this community is not tightly integrated with mutual dependencies; hence, many species can be removed without much affecting the rest of the ecosystem Read More: http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008{\%}5B0309:SBGARE{\%}5D2.0.CO;2},

abstract = {n the high Hawaiian Islands, significant accretion due to coral reef growth is limited by wave exposure and sea level. Holocene coral growth and reef accretion was measured at four stations off Oahu, Hawaii, chosen along a gradient in wave energy from minimum to maximum exposures. The results show that coral growth of living colonies (linear extension) at optimal depths is comparable at all stations (7.7-10.1 mm/y), but significant reef accretion occurs only at wave sheltered stations. At wave sheltered stations in Hanauma Bay and Kaneohe Bay, rates of long term reef accretion are about 2.0 mm/y. At wave exposed stations, off Mamala Bay and Sunset Beach, reef accretion rates are virtually zero in both shallow (1 m) and deeper (optimal) depths (12 m). At wave sheltered stations, such as Kaneohe Bay and Hanauma Bay, Holocene reef accretion is on the order of 10-15 m thick. At wave exposed stations, Holocene accretion is represented by only a thin veneer of living corals resting on antecedent Pleistocene limestone foundations. Modern coral communities in wave exposed environments undergo constant turnover associated with mortality and recruitment or re-growth of fragmented colonies and are rarely thicker than a single living colony. Breakage, scour, and abrasion of living corals during high wave events appears to be the major source of mortality and ultimately limits accretion to wave sheltered environments. Depth is particularly important as a modulator of wave energy. The lack of coral reef accretion along shallow open ocean coastlines may explain the absence of mature barrier reefs in the high Hawaiian Islands.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Marine macroalgae provide both food and habitat for a range of other organisms in near- shore coastal areas. The effect of contaminants upon macroalgae is therefore an important aspect to consider in the regulation of marine effluent discharges. Unfortunately, a lack of standardized bioassay protocols has limited the extent to which macroalgae have been used in routine toxicity testing. In the present study, the effect of selected reference toxicants (hexavalent chromium, copper and zinc) upon germination and growth of zoospores of the marine macroalga Ecklonia radiata (C.Ag.) J.Ag. was investigated in 48 h bioassays. E. radiata is often a dominant member of near-shore subtidal communi- ties in temperate Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, regions m which toxicological data for native species are lacking. Release of zoospores was induced in the laboratory and settled spores were exposed to the metals. Zoospores from 3 different populations in Western Australia and 1 population in Victoria were tested to evaluate geographic variation in response. There were no significant ddfer- ences in 48 h EC,, values between the populations tested. At 20C, EC,, values for germination ranged between 54.9 and 65.1 mg 1-' for chromium, 320 and 470 pg I-' for copper and 18.1 and 18.6 mg 1-' in 2 bioassays conducted with zinc. Germination of control zoospores was greater than 90{\%} in all bioassays. Germination tube growth was the more sensitive of the 2 endpoints examined. ECS0 values for growth ranged between 31.8 and 47.5 mg I-' for chromium and 180 and 210 pg 1-' for copper. Coefficients of variation for ECS0 values from tests with chromium or copper were between 24 and 47{\%} for germination and 11 and 54 {\%} for germination tube growth. With its wide distribution, ecological sig- nificance and simple bioassay methodology. E. radiata is well suited for use in routine marine toxicity testing. KEY},

In this study, primers were developed that spanned the noncoding intergenic region between the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 and cytochrome oxidase subunit 3 genes. These primers were demonstrated to be successful on a variety of red algae in different orders: Gracilariales, Bonnemaisoniales and Ceramiales (families: Delesseriaceae, Ceramiaceae and Rhodomelaceae). Amplification products were between 450 and 320 bp in length, with variation in length shown among geographically distant isolates within a species. The region was variable within a single species, as shown for Bostrychia moritziana and B. radicans, and within populations of Caloglossa leprieurii. In the latter species, four mitochondrial haplotypes were observed in isolates from a single locality in Woolooware Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Analysis of hybrids between different mitochondrial haplotypes of B. moritziana revealed that the mitochondria are maternally inherited in this species. This is the first report of a mitochondrial marker that is variable within red algal populations and may lead to a better understanding of the population ecology of these important marine organisms.},

abstract = {This paper integrates long-term descriptive and experimental studies of the effects of ocean climate on inter- and intraspecific competition, as expressed by recruitment, density, survivorship, growth, and reproduction of the most conspicuous kelp species in the Point Loma kelp forest community off San Diego, California, USA. The species included Macrocystis pyrifera, with a floating canopy; Pterygophora californica and Eisenia arborea, which rely on stipes to support their canopy; Laminaria farlowii, with a prostrate canopy; and a speciose red algal turf. To evaluate the roles of large-scale oceanographic processes on biological processes across important depth gradients, the study was carried out over nine years during a cold-water, nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a event (1988–1989) and a warm-water, nutrient-stressed El Nin ˜o period (1992–1994), over a depth range of 8–23 m. This depth range encompassed strong physical gradients involving factors that are critical for kelp growth, including bottom temperatures (correlated with nutrients) and light levels. To examine interactions among these kelps, we established clearings across the depth gradient and then manipulated Macrocystis recruit densities. The demographic responses offer an understanding of the ‘‘fundamental'' vs. ‘‘realized'' niches of these species. Eval- uating these patterns, as they are influenced by inter- and intraspecific competition, offers insights into the ‘‘realized niches'' of the kelps. With the exception of some understory effects on Macrocystis recruitment and some evidence of intraspecific competition during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a conditions, we found little influence of competitive effects on Macrocystis. The response of Pterygophora to manipulations and disturbances suggests light-limited recruitment, and competition with Macrocystis was exhibited via reduced growth and reproduction, but not survivorship. No nutrient stress was observed in Ptery- gophora reproduction. Eisenia recruitment is rare, but once established, juveniles had very good survivorship, with growth and reproduction reduced by depth; the Macrocystis treat- ment was more important than depth, suggesting the importance of light to Eisenia re- cruitment and growth. In general, Macrocystis had massive effects on Laminaria growth and reproduction, the strength varying with depth. In particular, there were very strong effects of competition with Macrocystis during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a period when Macrocystis had a dense surface canopy. In addition to the Macrocystis effects, there were some significant Pterygophora effects on Laminaria growth during El Nin ˜o. The strongest biological definition of realized niches occurred during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a period, especially in shallow depths. One of the most important conclusions of this paper is the appreciation of the importance of scaling in time to include oceanographic climate. There are many seasonal patterns, but the interannual scales that encompass El Nin ˜os and La Nin ˜as, and ultimately the interdecadal-scale oceanographic regime shifts that affect the intensity of canopy competition with Macrocystis, are critical for this system because surface-water nutrients have pervasive long-term effects on the other kelps. Small- scale patterns are driven by local processes (competition, disturbance, dispersal, etc.) that potentially are important at larger scales; however, our most lasting effects result from very large-scale, low-frequency episodic changes in nutrients, with cascading competitive con- sequences to the other algal populations in the community.

abstract = {In February 1998, Jasus edwardsii larval catches off the east coast of New Zealand were binomial in size and stage of development. Mid-stage larvae (presumed to be from the 1997 cohort) appeared to be contained within a large permanent eddy found offshore, known as the Wairarapa Eddy. Late-stage larvae (1996 cohort) have a different distribution from the mid-stage larvae, being found closer inshore of the eddy. Pueruli (also 1996 cohort) were found well inshore of the eddy. Surface currents derived from TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter measurements of sea level are used to simulate larval concentrations. The numerical simulations show that the different distributions of the 3 groups cannot be explained on the basis of advection alone. Mid-stage concentrations appear to be well described by passive drift alone, but the simulations suggest some mechanism inducing shoreward transport is needed for both pueruli and late-stage phyllosomas. Observed puerulus concentrations are best matched by adding a shorewards-directed speed of 8 to 10 cm/s for between 1 and 3 wk before the date of the cruise. Late-stage phyllosoma concentrations are best matched by adding speeds of 4 to 6 cm/s. Sustained shorewards swimming speeds of 8 to 10 cm/s are well within the estimates of swimming speed that have been reported elsewhere for pueruli. To our knowledge, extended directed horizontal swimming has not been reported for phyllosomas, yet in the final stage, the pleopods are almost as well developed as they are in the pueruli. These final stage larvae could well use forward pleopod propulsion, in conjunction with exopodal setai beating, to allow them to swim.},

abstract = {During the ENSO event of 1997–1998, density and population structure were evaluated in a Macro- cystis pyrifera forest located in Bahı ´a Tortugas, Baja California, Mexico, near the southern limit of the species' distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. Observations in Bahı ´a Tortugas were made quarter- ly from January 1997 to September 1998 using SCU- BA diving surveys. No macroscopic plants were found in the Bahı ´a Tortugas area from October 1997 to April 1998, a local absence of at least 7 months. Aerial surveys further suggest regional dis- appearance along most of the Baja California coast during the event. Unexpectedly, plants were found in Bahı ´a Tortugas again in July 1998, in spite of the widespread disappearance of the species less than a year earlier. Long-distance spore dispersal was an unlikely cause of the recruitment because: 1) the nearest spore source was more than 100 km away; 2) recruitment appeared to be simultaneous at many sites and occurred rapidly after the cessation of the ENSO event; and 3) the recruits occurred in the same areas as before disappearance. We suggest that a microscopic stage that was not visible during dive surveys survived the stressful conditions of ENSO and caused the recruitment event, supporting the hypothesis that a bank of microscopic forms can sur- vive conditions stressful to macroscopic algae},

The discovery that Porphyra improves growth of South African abalone ( Haliotis midae) farmed in land-based tanks has led to increased pressure to harvest wild populations. This paper reports on a survey of the distribution and seasonality of Porphyra in the southern Western Cape. Porphyra was present at all sites surveyed, and showed considerable temporal variation. A significant amount of the Porphyra present is in reserves and therefore protected from harvesting. Closer examination of one site revealed seasonal populations of Porphyra that occupied different niches dependent on season. Recruitment peaked in spring and autumn, leading to dense summer and winter populations. Summer populations generally grew lower in the eulittoral than winter populations. No pattern in the mortality of larger thalli was detected, though sporeling mortality was high following recruitment peaks. Although it seems that most sites in the southern Western Cape are suitable for harvesting, the taxonomy of the genus in the region urgently needs revision if populations are to be appropriately managed},

abstract = {Attempts to relate estimates of regional F(ST) to gene flow and drift via Wright's (1931) equation F(ST) ≃ 1/(4Nm + 1) are often inappropriate because most natural sets of populations probably are not at equilibrium (McCauley 1993), as assumed by the island model upon which the equation is based, or ineffective because the influences of gene flow and drift are confounded in the product Nm. Evaluations of the association between genetic (F(ST)) and geographic distances separating all pairwise populations combinations in a region allows one to test for regional equilibrium, to evaluate the relative influences of gene flow and drift on population structure both within and between regions, and to visualize the behavior of the association across all degrees of geographic separation. Tests of the model using microsatellite data from 51 populations of eastern collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris collaris) collected from four distinct geographical regions gave results highly consistent with predicted patterns of association based on regional differences in various historical and ecological factors that affect the amount of drift and gene flow. The model provides a prerequisite for and an alternative to regional F(ST) analyses, which often simply assume regional equilibrium, thus potentially leading to erroneous and misleading inferences regarding regional population structure},

abstract = {The effect of secondary treated sewage discharged from a recently commissioned extended ocean outfall at Boulder Bay, New South Wales, Australia on two bioindicators (oysters and kelp) was examined. Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea commercialis Iredale and Roughley, were deployed at the study outfall location and control locations for three months after which time they were retrieved and analysed for trace metal and organochlorine concentrations. This process was repeated every six months on a total of eight sampling times, three times before and five times after the commissioning of the extended ocean outfall. The abundance and recruitment of adult and juvenile kelp plants, Ecklonia radiata were also investigated. At the outfall and control locations counts were made for a total of three periods, one before and two after the commissioning of the outfall. Within each period kelp abundance was determined on three random occasions. Univariate statistics were used to test the hypothesis of an outfall effect over and above variation between the control locations. Only three organochlorines (technical chlordane and the DDT metabolites DDE and DDD) were detected in oysters across the entire sampling period. Due to the low frequency or low mean concentrations of organochlorines an impact versus control comparison was not feasible for this study. Mean concentrations of trace metals in oysters were highly variable across all sampling periods. No obvious changes in the contaminant concentrations were noticed over time. Statistical comparisons of the data collected before and after commissioning of the extended ocean outfall revealed no short-term differences in trace metal concentrations between outfall and control locations. Analysis of variance results for both adult and juvenile kelp abundance revealed no outfall effect over and above the variation found at control locations. Student Newman-Keuls tests, however, revealed a significantly higher abundance of both adult and juvenile kelp plants immediately after the commissioning of the outfall. The value of these bioindicators for detecting impacts at small secondary treated outfalls is discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract   In this paper a series of growth forms of the sponge Haliclona oculata, the hydrozoan Millepora alcicornis and the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis are morphologically analysed. The growth forms of these species were collected along a gradient of the amount of water movement. In this analysis it is demonstrated that, although these species are from very different taxonomical groups, the degree of compactness of the growth forms shows a similar trend as a response to the exposure to water movement. In all three species the growth forms gradually change from thin-branching to more compact shapes, as evaluated by measurements of various morphological characteristics. Other morphological measurements, in particular the average distance between branch tips and neighbouring branches ({\^{a}}€{\oe}branch spacing{\^{a}}€ ) show a more species-specific pattern. Species in which fusion of branches is almost never observed, as for example P. damicornis, are characterized by a relatively low standard deviation of branch spacing. Species in which anastomosis frequently occurs (H. oculata and M. alcicornis) are characterized by a relatively high standard deviation in branch spacing. The final aim of this research approach is to use the morphological data acquired here in combination with morphological simulation models to gain a better understanding of the growth and form of these organisms and the impact of the physical environment (hydrodynamics and availability of light required for photosynthesis).},

In this paper we report a total of 185 confirmed coastal species and 67 families. Twenty-seven of these are reported for the first time for the area, and three other unidentified species may represent new species to science. The best represented families are Carangidae (14 species), Serranidae (11 species), Gobiidae and Scombridae (8 species each). Despite its proximity to the African Continent, it is clear that these islands harbour a particular fish fauna, including several amphiatlantic species, which, in the eastern Atlantic, occur only around oceanic islands (e.g., Epinephelus ascencionis, Paranthias furcifer, Mulloidychtis martinicus, Bodianus pulchellus, Chromis multilineata, Gnatholepis thomsoni, Melychthis niger).

We use data from four remnant and three translocated sea otter ( Enhydra lutris) populations to examine relations among magnitude and duration of minimum population size, population growth rates, and genetic variation. Mitochondrial (mt)DNA haplotype diversity was correlated with the number of years at minimum population size (rs = −0.741, p = 0.038) and minimum population size (rs = 0.709, p = 0.054). We found no relation between population growth and haplotype diversity, although growth was significantly greater in translocated than in remnant populations. Haplotype diversity in populations established from two sources was higher than in a population established from a single source and was higher than in the respective source populations. Haplotype frequencies in translocated populations of founding sizes of 4 and 28 differed from expected, indicating genetic drift and differential reproduction between source populations, whereas haplotype frequencies in a translocated population with a founding size of 150 did not. Relations between population demographics and genetic characteristics suggest that genetic sampling of source and translocated populations can provide valuable inferences about translocations.

abstract = {We measured the rate of advance of urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) feeding aggregations (fronts) as they destructively grazed kelp beds (Laminaria longicruris) at both a wave-exposed site and a sheltered site in Nova Scotia over 3.5 years. The grazing fronts were composed of high densities of large adults (up to 98 and 70 per 0.25 m(2) at the exposed and sheltered sites, respectively). Urchins in the recently formed barrens, or in adjacent kelp beds, occurred at much lower densities and consisted mainly of juveniles. The fronts moved onshore into shallower water at each site, but their rate of advance varied markedly between sites and over time at each site, ranging from 0 to 4 m.month(-1). The rate of advance of a front was related to the biomass of urchins; fronts did not advance below a threshold biomass of similar to 2 kg.m(-2). Infestations of kelp by an epiphytic bryozoan (Membranipora membranacea) caused marked reductions in kelp canopy cover and biomass during winter, but the canopy regenerated through recruitment of juvenile sporophytes in spring. A localized outbreak of disease decimated S. droebachiensis at the exposed site in 1993, which enabled kelp to recolonize the barrens. Surviving urchins gradually reaggregated and resumed destructive grazing after similar to 1.5 years. A recurrence of disease in 1995 eliminated urchins at both sites and terminated the transition from kelp beds to barrens on a coastal scale. Our findings have important implications for the management of the urchin fishery, which targets grazing fronts for harvesting.},

Samples of 15-30 mature receptacle-bearing plants were collected by SCUBA diving from 19 sampling points on moderately exposed and exposed shores along the salinity gradient in the Gulf of Finland and in the Bothnian Sea. Eight morphological characteristics were measured and then analyzed using linear regression analysis and stepwise discriminant analysis. The analyses indicate considerable morphological divergence according to decreasing salinity. In both the Gulf of Finland and in the Bothnian Sea the width and length of thallus as well as dis-tance of dichotomies and stipe dimensions decreased along the gradient. Along the exposed shores, plants are shorter and have narrower fronds. The change in morphology towards the low salinity areas is a clinal one and different morpho-logical types can be distinguished to a certain extent.

abstract = {Drifting rafts of Macrocystis pyrifera are formed when attached plants are separated from the substrate. These kelp rafts have the potential to disperse fauna among isolated kelp forests; however, the success of this dispersal mechanism will be influenced by the abundance and the dispersal paths of the rafts. The abundance of kelp rafts in the Southern California Eight (SCB) was estimated from the loss of attached plants, and by direct observation of rafts at sea. Loss of attached adult plants was highest in winter (23{\%}) and lowest in fall (8{\%}) at 7 sites within 2 coastal kelp beds over the period of 1988 to 1998. Raft density at sea differed among 4 cruises in the period from 1995 to 1997, and ranged from 0.78 to 6.96 km(-2) (average 3.02 km(-2)). In the SCB these densities correspond to an instantaneous abundance of between 39 000 and 348 000 drifting rafts. The potential raft dispersal paths and the frequency of exchanges among kelp forests were evaluated using satellite-tracked drifters. Southward dispersal away from the coast was observed in all months of the year. Dispersal north, both along the coast and away from the coast, was most likely between July and January (summer-winter), while dispersal south along the coast was likely between January and August (late winter and early spring). A definition of a 'successful connection event' was adopted, based on a drifter starting less than 10 km and ending less than 5 km from the coast. Under this definition, 45{\%} of all drifter releases were successful. Analysis of the temporal pattern and drift trajectories of the mainland-mainland successes revealed that Pt. Conception was always a boundary for north to south connections, but was open to south to north connections between fall and winter (October to January). Drifters released and remaining north or south of Pt. Conception were successful throughout the year. Connections were not made more than 300 km from a release region, under any criteria for success. The results of this study indicate that while rafts may drift long distances, successful connection of kelp forests through kelp rafts is limited to shorter distances.},

abstract = {Field and laboratory experiments demonstrate that juveniles of South African abalone (Haliotis midae) depend vitally on the protection from predation that they gain from living concealed beneath Cape urchins (Parechinus angulosus). Recent reports suggest that rock lobsters (Jasus lalandii) have increased substantially in the region where the commercial abalone fishery is centered. This increase has been blamed for a recorded collapse of urchin populations and dramatic reductions in the numbers of juvenile abalone. We verified the substantial increase in rock lobster abundance there. Surveys covering 200 km of coastline showed that densities of urchins were negatively correlated with those of large lobsters 68 mm carapace length) and that densities of juvenile abalone were positively correlated with those of urchins. The indirect negative effects of rock lobsters on juvenile abalone clearly pose a major threat to the abalone industry, already under stress from poaching. Quantification of the relationship between juvenile abalone and urchins and between urchins and rock lobsters allows a forecast of the magnitude of lobster harvesting necessary to reduce them to a level at which urchins may recover and sustain juvenile abalone. The complex interactions involved emphasize the importance of an ecosystem approach for the management of these stocks.},

@article{Stewart2000,
abstract = {Many fish species are cryptic by nature or show a negative response to divers. This may make traditional censusing techniques difficult to perform and the results obtained using these methods may be inaccurate. This problem will be exacerbated in complex habitats, such as those found on coral reefs, because the cryptic species present will be even more difficult to locate and identify. Predation studies on coral reefs have been especially hampered by this problem because many predatory species are cryptic and so it has been difficult to obtain reliable abundance estimates. This study tested a visual census technique that used bait to bring cryptic predatory fish into view. Results from this census were then compared to those from a traditional survey using belt transects, and to a patch reef tagging study where all individuals of 3 key species were located. The baited technique produced significantly higher density estimates for 3 of the 4 most abundant cryptic species. The patch reef experiment demonstrated that the baited technique accounted for 85 to 96 {\%} of fish present. Censuses without bait observed only 40 to 61 {\%} of fish present. For mobile species, on the other hand, the baited census appeared to overestimate abundance, due to movement of fish into the census area. We therefore recommend combining baited censuses of sedentary cryptic species with traditional censuses of mobile species to gain an accurate picture of piscivorous reef fish communities. Using this approach at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef, the proportion of cryptic piscivores in the community was found to be almost double that which would have otherwise been observed. We also found considerable spatial variation in the abundance and distribution of piscivorous fish. These patterns would have been quite different had the survey been based on belt transects alone. Previous studies using belt transects may therefore have underestimated the importance of cryptic piscivorous species in communities of coral reef fish.},

To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. Positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98{\%} were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10{\%}) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone. Because juvenile abalone seem dependent on the urchins. The long-term consequences for the industry may be crucial.},

abstract = {The subtidal understorey seaweed communities were studied along a coastal distance of 104km around the Cape Peninsula, which is situated in an overlap region between two marine provinces and characterized by a considerable temperature gradient. Sampling was carried out at six sites (4 to 10 quadrats per site) around the Cape Peninsula. For each of the quadrats, biomass of each species, grazing, and environmental variables such as temperature, wave exposure and sand cover were determined. The data were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and two way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). A total of 142 seaweed taxa were found at the six sites (21 Chlorophyta, 14 Phaeophyta and 107 Rhodophyta). The two sides of the Peninsula have a very different biomass-composition of Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta. The biomass of Rhodophyta in the Atlantic sites is much higher than in the Bay, and the biomass of Chlorophyta is higher in False Bay than on the west coast. A change in tloristic composition of subtidal algal communities around the Cape Peninsula can be observed and is principally related to seawater temperature and wave exposure. Next to these physical factors, grazing is demonstrated to be important in determining species composition. A lower degree of wave exposure might result in a higher number of grazers in False Bay. The occurrence of a higher cover of encrusting corallines in the Bay is probably a consequence of the higher grazing pressure. Distinct community types can be recognized from TWINSPAN and CCA.

abstract = {Clusters of range boundaries in coastal marine species often occur at shoreline locations where major nearshore ocean currents collide. Observing that these currents are typically composed of waters with quite different physical characteristics, biologists have traditionally assumed that high local densities of marine range limits result primarily from the strong water property gradients (particularly in temperature) that arise at oceanographic discontinuities. However, this view may overlook the potential for ocean flows themselves to generate distributional pattern. Here we explore this possibility in more detail using an extension of a coupled population dispersal model developed previously for benthic marine species with dispersing larvae. Results suggest that simple, common flow fields often observed in association with biogeographic boundaries worldwide may have the potential to constrain a species' geographic range, even when suitable habitat outside that range is abundant. Model predictions suggest that these boundaries can function as one- or two-way barriers to range expansion and may be differentially permeable, with boundary leakiness depending on life-history characteristics and the degree of temporal variability in the nearshore flow field.},

Temperature and food availability are crucial to the dynamics of benthic suspension feeders.

Conceptual issues include the widespread occurrence of transphyletic use of the same resources (space and food), theories and experimental analyses of intermediate disturbance in relation to numbers of species, the complex but pervasive nature of indirect interactions among species, relative importance of 'top-down' versus 'bottom-up' control of assemblages and the importance to rocky intertidal species of 'supply-side' influences on densities and interactions. Methodological advances include experimental designs for complex and patchy, interacting sets of species, the importance of controls in experimental manipulations and methods for analyses of hierarchical scales of patterns and processes.

abstract = {Estuaries and associated coastal waters support many essential fisheries, a fact which contributes to their disproportionately high economic value. They are, however, also among the most extensively modified and threatened of aquatic environments. Almost all have been strongly affected by human beings, and fisheries are an integral part of human activities on the coast. We have taken a global perspective in synthesizing the effects of fishing on estuaries and coastal waters. Rather than attempt to cover all regions of the world in detail, we review eight process-orientated categories affected by fishing, with case studies for each of them: target organisms, non-target organisms, nursery functions, trophic effects, habitat change, reduced water quality, human environment, and potential for local extinctions. Fishing in the estuarine and near-shore environment has clear impacts on the structure and functioning of these ecosystems, although other, non-fishing issues also effect these ecosystems. This creates multiple interactions and reinforces the need for an integrated approach to coastal zone management. Nonetheless, some form of fish-based action plan could be created, especially within estuaries, which would provide management objectives for a particular system.},

abstract = {In upwelling ecosystems, there is often a crucial intermediate trophic level, occupied by small, plankton-feeding pelagic fish dominated by one or a few schooling species. Their massive populations may vary radically in size under intensive exploitation. We have used decadal-scale time series to explore patterns of interactions between these fish, their prey, and their predators so as to quantify functional roles of small pelagic fish in those ecosystems. Top-down control of zooplankton is detected off South Africa, Ghana, Japan, and in the Black Sea. Conversely, bottom-up control of predators, such as predatory fish and marine birds, is observed in the Benguela, Guinea, and Humboldt currents. Thus small pelagic fish exert a major control on the trophic dynamics of upwelling ecosystems and constitute midtrophic-level ‘‘wasp-waist'' populations. Ecosystem effects of fishing are addressed by considering potential structural changes at different scales of observation, ranging from individ- uals, via school dynamics, to food webs. The overall impact is explored using a trophic model (Ecosim) given different types of food web control. Ecosystem dynamics can be entirely different depending on how the food web is controlled (bottom-up, top-down or wasp-waist). The threat of eroding intra-specific diversity is emphasized because it may lead to a long-term decline in the productivity of the pelagic fish resources. School composition is shown to reflect the relative species abundance within the pelagic community and functions as a ‘‘school trap'' that could maintain a collapsed population in a depleted state for lengthy periods, and affect spatial dynamics such as migrations. As a result, overfishing can alter the abundance, composition, and distribution in pelagic communities, and may induce drastic changes of state. Predation on zooplankton by the jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus murphyi) population in the South Pacific provides an example of the alteration of matter fluxes in trophic webs caused by fishery removals. In conclusion, it is doubtful that pelagic fisheries will continue to increase without major disruptions to ecosystems.},

abstract = {The impact of fishing on chondrichthyan stocks around the world is currently the focus of considerable international concern. Most chondrichthyan populations are of low productivity relative to teleost fishes, a consequence of their different life-history strategies. This is reflected in the poor record of sustainability of target shark fisheries. Most sharks and some batoids are predators at, or near, the top of marine food webs. The effects of fishing are examined at the single-species level and through trophic interactions. We summarize the status of chondrichthyan fisheries from around the world. Some 50{\%} of the estimated global catch of chondrichthyans is taken as by-catch, does not appear in official fishery statistics, and is almost totally unmanaged. When taken as by-catch, they are often subjected to high fishing mortality directed at teleost target species. Consequently, some skates, sawfish, and deep-water dogfish have been virtually extirpated From large regions. Some chondrichthyans are more resilient to fishing and we examine predictions on the vulnerability of different species based on their life-history and population parameters. At the species level, fishing may alter size structure and population parameters in response to changes in species abundance. We review the evidence for such density-dependent change. Fishing can affect trophic interactions and we examine cases of apparent species replacement and shifts in community composition. Sharks and rays learn to associate trawlers with food and feeding on discards may increase their populations. Using ECOSIM, we make some predictions about the long-term response of ecosystems to fishing on sharks. Three different environments are analysed: a tropical shelf ecosystem in Venezuela, a Hawaiian coral reef ecosystem, and a North Pacific oceanic ecosystem.

abstract = {Destructive macroalgal mass blooms threaten estuarine and coastal ecosystems worldwide. We asked which factors regulate macroalgal bloom intensity, distribution and species composition. In field experiments in the Baltic Sea, we analyzed the relative effects of nutrients, herbivores and algal propagule banks on population development and dominance patterns in two co-occurring bloom-forming macroalgae, Enteromorpha intestinalis and Pilayella littoralis. Both species were highly affected by the combined effects of a propagule bank, herbivory and nutrients. The magnitude of effects varied with season. The propagule bank was an important overwintering mechanism for both algae, and allowed for recruitment two months earlier than recruitment via freshly dispersed propagules. This provided a seasonal escape from intense herbivory and nutrient limitation later in the year. Favored by massive recruitment from the propagule bank, Enteromorpha was the superior space occupier in early spring, thereby reducing recruitment of Pilayella. Elimination of the propagule bank and recruitment via freshly dispersed propagules favored Pilayella. Strong and selective herbivory on Enteromorpha supported Pilayella in the presence, but not in the absence of the propagule bank. Nutrient enrichment in summer counteracted herbivore pressure on Enteromorpha, thereby negatively affecting Pilayella. Herbivore and nutrient effects were more pronounced for early life stages than adult algae. These results show that recruitment processes and forces affecting early life stages at the beginning of the vegetation period determine development and dominance patterns of macroalgal blooms. Herbivores naturally suppress blooms but increasing nutrient enrichment can override this important control mechanism. The propagule bank plays a previously unrecognized role for population and community dynamics.},

abstract = {Kelp forests, highly diverse cold water communities organized around the primary productivity and physical structure provided by members of the Laminariales, support a variety of fisheries, and the kelp itself is harvested for alginates. Worldwide, these communities generally share susceptibility to destructive overgrazing by sea urchins. The impact of sea-urchin grazing is governed by the ratio between food availability and grazing pressure, thus factors affecting the abundance of both urchins and kelps are central to ecosystem integrity. Some kelp ecosystems share a second generality, the association of exploitation of various urchin predators with destructive levels of urchin grazing, leading to cascading implications for other species dependent on the productivity and habitat provided by the kelps. Competition between abalones and sea urchins also affects some kelp communities. These ecosystem-structuring processes are complicated by a variety of bottom-up and top-down factors, including variability in ocean climate affecting kelp productivity and recruitment of key species, and echinoid disease. Potential ecosystem effects of fisheries for predators, abalones, sea urchins, and kelps are reviewed biogeographically. Given the hundreds to thousands of years that many nearshore marine ecosystems have been exploited, no-take marine reserves may be the only way to determine the true ecosystem effects of fishing.},

Recent surveys of Mediterranean taxa show different patterns from those observed in cold temperate seas, which are characterized by winter dormancy. In the Mediterranean, summer dormancy predominates among taxa and appears to be related to energetic constraints. Temperature and food availability are crucial to the dynamics of benthic suspension feeders. However, because these factors tend to be positively correlated in cold temperate seas, it is difficult to distinguish between their effects. Such correlation does not occur in Mediterranean ecosystems. The contrast between recent studies in the Mediterranean and in other areas can help to disentangle confounded environmental controls.},

Greater genetic similarity of patches occurred at a wave-sheltered site than at a wave-exposed site. The lower wave action may limit meiospore dispersal, resulting in patches of related sporophytes. Genetic similarities between A. marginata stands indicated a pattern of gene flow that is consistent with local currents. In one stand, genetic similarities were markedly different between seasons. This seasonal pattern may be the result of different age groups dominating the sampled stands over time. The genetic structure of A. marginata comprises local scale (patch and within-stand) heterogeneity and larger scale (between-stands) homogeneity.},

abstract = {Human wading in shallow coastal waters is a common activity that inherently involves trampling of the substrate. An experiment was conducted in Thalassia testudinum seagrass beds in Puerto Rico to determine how seagrass and associated mobile fauna respond to this anthropogenic disturbance. Three trampling intensities were applied to replicate seagrass beds throughout a 4 mo period. Seagrass biomass was inversely related to trampling intensity and duration. There was moderate recovery in the trampled areas 7 mo after the last trampling event. Intense levels of trampling resulted in decreased shrimp abundances, especially for Thor manningi. Fish abundances and composition of shrimp and fish assemblages did not change significantly after 4 mo of trampling. T. testudinum beds with softer substrates lost more seagrass biomass as a result of trampling than seagrass beds with firm substrates, suggesting that substrate firmness can modify disturbance effects. Educators and resource managers should limit trampling by large groups, or confine it to small areas with firm substrates, and researchers should be mindful of artifacts arising from trampling in and around sampling areas.},

abstract = {The effect of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the probability distribution of daily surface air temperature over the Pacific-North American sector is investigated using the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis data for 1959-1998. The El Nino response is characterized by reduced intraseasonal variance over most of the US, western Canada and the Gulf of Alaska. Conversely, there is an increase of variance during La Nino over the US and the west coast, northward to Alaska. The sign of this response is consistent for most individual El Nino/La Nina years in regions with a strong signal. The response is also robust with respect to differing definitions of ENSO or choice of dataset. Finally, a similar response is evident in station data for an earlier period. The change of variance is associated both with altered skewness, and a change in high and low extremes. Extremes of both signs are reduced during El Nino, and are slightly increased during La Nina. These results are consistent with other studies, suggesting an increased incidence of blocking along the west coast of North America during El Nino, leading to less storm activity and less incursions of warm and cold air over the eastern US. While an understanding of the changed variance is important in itself, it also has implications for changes in exceedence statistics (e.g. heating degree days) and the occurrence of extreme values.

This review considers how the hydrodynamic environment in which macroalgae grow influences their ability to acquire essential re- sources and how macroalgae might respond physio- logically to fluctuations in their hydrodynamic re- gime with a focus on: (1) the biochemical processes occurring within the diffusion boundary layer (DBL) that might reduce rates of macroalgal production; (2) time scales over which measurements of velocity and DBL processes should be made, discussing the likelihood of in situ mass transfer limitation; (3) if and how macroalgal morphology influences resource acquisition in slow flows; and (4) ecobiomechanics and how hydrodynamic drag might influence re- source acquisition and allocation.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was fractionated by ultrafiltration into 1-30 kDa (HDOM) and 30 kDa-0.2 $\mu$m (VHDOM) nominal molecular weight fractions. Thermochemolysis with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was used to release and quantify lipids and lignin phenols. Stable carbon isotopes, fatty acids and lignin content indicated shifts in sources with terrigenous material in the river and turbid region and a predominantly algal/planktonic signal in the lower estuary and coastal ocean. Thermochemolysis with TMAH released significant amounts of short chain fatty acids (C9-C13), not seen by traditional alkaline hydrolysis, which appear to be associated with the macromolecular matrix. Lignin phenol distributions in HDOM, VHDOM and particles followed predicted sources with higher concentrations in the river and turbid region of the estuary and lower concentrations in the coastal ocean. TOM comprised 12{\%} of HDOM within the coastal ocean and up to 73{\%} of HDOM within the turbid region of the estuary. In the coastal ocean, TOM from high molecular weight DOM comprised 4{\%} of total DOC. The annual flux of TOM from the Delaware Estuary to the coastal ocean was estimated at 2.0×1010g OC year-1and suggests that temperate estuaries such as Delaware Bay can be significant sources of TOM on a regional scale. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Strong top-down control by consumers has been demonstrated in rocky intertidal communities around the world. In contrast, the role of bottom-up effects (nutrients and productivity), known to have important influences in terrestrial and particularly freshwater ecosystems, is poorly known in marine hard-bottom communities. Recent studies in South Africa, New England, Oregon and New Zealand suggest that bottom-up processes can have important effects on rocky intertidal community structure. A significant aspect of all of these studies was the incorporation of processes varying on larger spatial scales than previously considered (10's to 1000's of km). In all four regions, variation in oceanographic factors (currents, upwelling, nutrients, rates of particle flux) was associated with different magnitudes of algal and/or phytoplankton abundance, availability of particulate food, and rates of recruitment. These processes led to differences in prey abundance and growth, secondary production, consumer growth, and consumer impact on prey resources. Oceanographic conditions therefore may vary on scales that generate ecologically significant variability in populations at the bottom of the food chain, and through upward-flowing food chain effects, lead to variation in top-down trophic effects. I conclude that top-down and bottom-up processes can be important joint determinants of community structure in rocky intertidal habitats, and predict that such effects will occur generally wherever oceanographic 'discontinuities' lie adjacent to rocky coastlines. I further argue that increased attention by researchers and of funding agencies to such benthic-pelagic coupling would dramatically enhance our understanding of the dynamics of marine ecosystems.

Four major assemblages, comprising zooplankton, kelp-associated spe- cies, inter-island and nearshore benthos, were considered. Despite consumers exhibiting a pre- dictable enrichment in $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N with trophic position, only the zooplankton community dis- played distinct trophic levels. The benthic and the kelp-associated communities showed trophic continua. Both pelagic (zooplankton) and benthic inter-island communities ultimately derived their diets from phytoplankton (associated with surface-water POM). However, planktonic grazers fed pri- marily on allochthonous nano- and pico-plankton, while inter-island benthos seemed to rely mostly on microphytoplankton derived from autochthonous blooms. In contrast, kelp-associated animals derived a high proportion of their diet from kelp. The nearshore benthic community had an inter- mediate position between kelp-associated and inter-island communities. While POM was of primary importance, kelp-derived organic matter accounted on average for {\textgreater}30{\%} of the nearshore animals' diet. Findings of the present study indicate for the first time that autochthonous sources of organic matter (e.g. kelp-derived and microphytoplankton blooms), are important components of the diets of all but the zooplankton community at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands.},

Here, I determined that microscopic life stages of the annual marine macroalga Desmarestia ligulata overwinter during periods when the macroscopic thalli are absent, thereby allowing this species to persist in temporally variable environments. Examination of field-grown microscopic stages with fluorescence microscopy identified these stages as gametophytes. Holdfast tagging experiments determined that recruitment of the macroscopic stages was not enhanced by regrowth of perennial thalli as observed in other macroalgae, suggesting that overwintering gametophytes were the sole source of sporophyte recruitment. In contrast to true resting stages, Desmarestia gametophytes were not dormant, but rather were metabolically active, sensitive to small differences in environmental quality, and highly subject to physical damage. Gametophyte photosynthetic rates were greater under higher irradiance, and growth rates were greater under longer photoperiods and higher irradiance. Although their survival appeared to be reduced by grazing from large ({\textgreater}1 cm) invertebrates and sedimentation, gametophytes. were able to survive in the field for at least 15 mo and thereby enhance sporophyte recruitment more than a year after settlement. I suggest that Desmarestia gametophytes be regarded as alternate life-history stages that simply maintain populations under a different set of environmental conditions than the macroscopic sporophytes do, rather than as ''dormant" or "resting" stages.},

abstract = {Video recordings have become a common method for monitoring the benthic environment around salmon farms, but generally they are only assessed qualitatively. We made a quantitative assessment of video recordings and compared the results with benthic invertebrate faunal data from the same sites. Transects around two Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) farms were videoed, with environmental variables that clearly showed change with levels of organic enrichment ranked according to their degree of occurrence. These variables included Beggiatoa cover, pellets and faeces, sediment colour, and abundance of flora and fauna. Analysis of the data by multivariate statistics indicated that quantitative data from video recordings can clearly detect major organic enrichment, but that they are not as sensitive as benthic infaunal data to lower levels of disturbance. This assessment technique will need to be tailored to different environmental conditions, but shows promise for long-term monitoring programs. {\textcopyright} 2001 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {A lobster-trap video (LTV) system was developed to determine how lobster traps fish for Homarus americanus and how behavioural interactions in and around traps influence catch. LTV consists of a low-light camera and time-lapse video cassette recorder (VCR) mounted to a standard trap with optional red LED arrays for night observations. This self-contained system is deployed like a standard lobster trap and can collect continuous video recordings for {\textgreater}24 h. Data are presented for 13 daytime deployments of LTV (114 h of observation) and 4 day and night deployments (89 h of observation) in a sandy habitat off the coast of New Hampshire, USA. Analyses of videotapes revealed that traps caught only 6{\%} of the lobsters that entered while allowing 94{\%} to escape. Of those that escaped, 72{\%} left through the entrance and 28{\%} through the escape vent. Lobsters entered the trap at similar rates during the day and night and in sandy and rocky habitats. Lobsters generally began to approach the trap very shortly after deployment, and many appeared to approach several times before entering. These data confirm the results of previous laboratory-based studies in demonstrating that behavioural interactions in and around traps strongly influence the ultimate catch.},

abstract = {A series of local factors such as substrate structure, presence or absence of kelp forests and environmental variables play an important role in determining both the diversity and abundance of temperate reef fish assemblages. The presence of kelp forests has been shown to increase struc- tural complexity, available shelter, and prey availability in the reef environment. This, in turn, may affect the structural organization of the fish assemblage. In this study, the diversity, abundance and trophic patterns of subtidal fish assemblages at 2 localities off the northern Chilean coast were ana- lyzed. These localities differ markedly in their spatial structure: the subtidal substratum at Caleta Err{\'{a}}zuriz is characterized by a sloping bedrock with large rocks and boulders and a kelp forest, while at Carrizal Bajo it consists of a sharply declining bedrock with few boulders and isolated kelp stands. We hypothesized that structurally highly complex habitats would exhibit higher diversity, abundance and a more complex trophic organization in terms of more functional groups and guilds of reef fish assemblages than less structured environments. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found similar species diversity and fish abundance at both localities. However, there were clear differences in species dom- inance, number of functional groups and trophic guilds. There were also marked differences in the trophic webs between localities. In the presence of kelp forest, both carnivores and omnivores con- sumed mainly benthic prey inhabiting the understory canopy, while in its absence carnivores fed on pelagic prey in the water column. Therefore, a more complex spatial structure would seem to support a more complex trophic organization with a greater degree of connectivity, as well as interaction between the species in a reef fish assemblage.

abstract = {Adaptive mechanical tolerance of Laminaria japonica to water motion was examined by field transplant and laboratory flow-tank experiments. L. japonica attaching to plastic plates were obtained at mid-water platforms sheltered from and moderately exposed to wave action. The environmental water velocities were determined during the cultivation period and transplant experiment using ultrasonic flow meters and available offshore wave height records. When transplanted to 3 depth sites with different intensities of wave-induced water motion, almost all the 'sheltered' plants were dislodged from the plastic plates by waves within 5 d, while most of the 'exposed' ones remained attached even at the shallowest depth 72 d after transplantation. This difference in mechanical tolerance was quantified by a flow-tank experiment conducted in sinusoidal oscillatory flows: 50{\%} of the 'sheltered' plants were dislodged at a velocity amplitude of 0.8 to 0.9 m s-1, while all of the 'exposed' plants persisted even at 1.1 ms-1. The maximum water velocities encountered by the transplants were estimated using ultrasonic flow meter records and the period-averaged water speeds, which were determined by correlating water velocity with decreased mass of gypsum blocks. These estimates coupled with the observed survivorships at the transplant sites were consistent with the results of the flow-tank experiment. Attachment strength increased significantly as the holdfast grew for the 'exposed' plants but was constant for the 'sheltered' ones. In addition, the 'sheltered' plants had a short, wide, undulated blade which resulted in higher drag while the 'exposed' plants had a long, narrow, flat blade and thereby lower drag. Despite the marked difference in tolerance to water motion, the frequency distribution of the root-mean-square water velocity experienced by plants during the growth period was only 0.05 m s-1 higher at the exposed culture station than at the sheltered one, suggesting the presence of a critical velocity in developing the adaptive mechanical tolerance. The observed dislodgement velocity for the 'sheltered' plants was considerably lower than predicted from general hydrodynamic theories describing attachment strength of a thallus stretched out in the direction of flow. This indicates that detailed dynamic behaviors of plants should be explored to predict the wave-induced mechanical failure in large, flexible algae such as L. japonica.},

abstract = {Plants are often grouped as canopy species or understorey species because it is thought that that these sets of taxa interact in predictable ways. Mensurative experiments in southern Australia demonstrated that the percentage cover of encrusting coralline algae was greater, and articulated (branching) coralline algae less, on boulders under a canopy of dense kelp ({\textgreater}7 plants per m(2)), Ecklonia radiata, than on boulders without kelp. Experimental clearances of kelp and reciprocal transplants of boulders between patches of E. Radiata and patches without kelp showed that canopies maintained and facilitated the growth of encrusting coralline algae and reduced the cover of articulated coralline algae. Potential artefacts associated with clearing kelp and transplanting boulders were not detected when tested with a series of translocation controls. These results reject the model that the co-occurrence of E. Radiata and encrusting corallines is just an assemblage of plants caused by spatial and temporal coincidence. Instead, they support the model that kelp facilitates the growth and survival of understorey algae.},

abstract = {There remains little understanding of the relationship between the ecologies of urban habitats (pilings and pontoons) and natural habitats (rocky reef) for sessile plants and animals (epibiota) living on urbanised coasts. This study describes the structure of subtidal assemblages of epibiota among pilings, pontoons and adjacent rocky reef in Sydney Harbour, Australia. I tested the prediction that the experimental provision of substrata of the same age and composition in all three habitats would produce assemblages that: (1) differed among all three habitats; and (2) differed most on floating pontoons relative to the two fixed habitats (pilings and reef). As predicted, the results suggested that both pilings and pontoons, particularly the latter, create novel habitats for epibiotic assemblages independent of age and composition of substratum. It is not fully understood why these urban structures act as such different habitats from natural rocky reefs. The important point is that they are different and we are yet to understand the implications of this for the ecology of coastal areas subject to urbanisation.

abstract = {Since its introduction to Nova Scotia in the early 1990s, the invasive green alga Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides has spread rapidly to become a dominant and persistent component of seaweed assemblages in the rocky subtidal zone. To examine the potential of sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) to regulate Codium, and the potential of the alga to support urchin growth and reproduction, we fed urchins Codium and/or kelp (Laminaria spp., a high quality and preferred native food) in the laboratory for 11 months. Urchins showed a strong and active preference for kelp: they consumed more Laminaria than Codium (as dry weight) in single and mixed diet treatments. Urchins fed only Codium consumed 3.5 times more of the alga than those on a mixed diet, but did not increase their feeding rate in winter when kelp consumption was greatest. Laminaria was consumed at the same rate in single and mixed diets, indicating that the presence of an alternative food had no effect on kelp consumption. Survival and growth (change in test diameter) were lowest on the Codium diet, although the differences among diets were not statistically significant. Urchins on the Codium diet showed no gonadal production over the annual reproductive cycle, compared to a marked rise in gonad index on the Laminaria and mixed diets. Our results indicate that Codium is an unattractive, unpalatable and poor quality food, which is not readily consumed by urchins. Thus we predict that urchins at moderate densities will be much more likely to graze kelp than Codium in mixed stands, creating a mosaic of Codium patches and barren areas. At high densities, however, urchins are likely to destructively graze all seaweeds, although dense stands of the invasive alga may prolong the widespread formation of barrens.},

abstract = {Evechinus chloroticus (Val.) is known to be an important grazer of subtidal barren habitats in northern New Zealand but its role in structuring rocky reef communities at colder southern localities is poorly understood. The present study was prompted by a proposal for the establishment of an E. Chloroticus fishery in Dusky Sound, Fiordland, New Zealand. To determine the ecological importance of E. Chloroticus in Dusky Sound, sea urchins were experimentally removed from shallow fucoid fringe (upper zone), mid-depth barrens (middle zone), and deeper algal meadow (lower zone), at eight sites and compared with a paired set of eight control sites. Two years of continuous removal of E. Chloroticus resulted in conspicuous changes to the algal community at all depth zones examined. The density of fucoid algae (Carpophyllum spp., Sargassum spp., Cystophora spp., and Landsburgia quercifolia) increased mostly in the upper and middle zones, although smaller increases were also observed in the lower zone. Changes in cover of herbaceous, turfing and crustose algae observed in the middle and lower zones were larger than in the upper zone. Density increases of the kelp Ecklonia radiata were observed mainly in the lower zone, although still important in the middle zone. These results show that E. Chloroticus can have a strong influence on the structure of algal assemblages in Dusky Sound hence the development of an E. Chloroticus fishery in this area should be treated with caution.},

abstract = {Despite widespread acceptance that competition between scleractinian corals and benthic algae is important to the structure of coral reef communities there is little direct experimental evidence that corals and algae do compete, and very little data on the processes and causality of their interactions. Most available evidence is observational or correlative, with intrinsic risks of confounded causality. This paper reviews and categorises the available evidence, concluding that competition between corals and algae probably is widespread on coral reefs, but also that the interaction varies considerably. Widespread replacement of corals by algae may often indicate coral mortality due to external disturbances. rather than competitive overgrowth, but may lead to competitive inhibition of coral recruitment. with consequences for reef recovery. We list eight specific processes by which corals and algae may affect each other, and suggest life history properties that will influence which of these interactions are possible. We propose a matrix for algal effects on corals, which lists the subset of processes possible for each combination of coral life form and algal functional group. This table provides a preliminary framework for improved understanding and interpretation of coral-algal interactions.},

Concurrent ecological surveys have demonstrated the dependence of juvenile abalone on urchins for their survival, and a radical increase in the abundance of lobsters in the area that is the main abalone fishing ground. This paper describes laboratory experiments on the consumption of urchins by lobsters, and the preferences for different prey species. Small lobsters ({\textless}68 mm carapace length) ate no urchins. Larger lobsters ate urchins of all sizes, although small urchins were preferred. The consumption rate was easily sufficient for the lobsters to have caused the documented disappearance of urchins ( and juvenile abalone) in the main abalone fishing area. Lobsters showed a strong preference for mussels over all other prey offered, and for juvenile abalone over urchins, although previous field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that urchins provide shelter for juvenile abalone. However, if black mussels were available in addition to sea urchins and juvenile abalone, consumption of sea urchins and juvenile abalone declined.},

Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and wider extremes of conditions than larger lakes and rivers. The stability of physical systems and degree of spatial connectivity contribute to increased diversity in both larger stream and larger lake systems. We identify challenges and needs that must be addressed both to advance the field of fish community ecology and to face the problems associated with human-induced changes.},

abstract = {Five test runs were performed to assess possible bias when performing the loss on ignition (LOI) method to estimate organic matter and carbonate content of lake sediments. An accurate and stable weight loss was achieved after 2 h of burning pure CaCO3 at 950 °C, whereas LOI of pure graphite at 530 °C showed a direct relation to sample size and exposure time, with only 40–70{\%} of the possible weight loss reached after 2 h of exposure and smaller samples losing weight faster than larger ones. Experiments with a standardised lake sediment revealed a strong initial weight loss at 550 °C, but samples continued to lose weight at a slow rate at exposure of up to 64 h, which was likely the effect of loss of volatile salts, structural water of clay minerals or metal oxides, or of inorganic carbon after the initial burning of organic matter. A further test-run revealed that at 550 °C samples in the centre of the furnace lost more weight than marginal samples. At 950 °C this pattern was still apparent but the differences became negligible. Again, LOI was dependent on sample size. An analytical LOI quality control experiment including ten different laboratories was carried out using each laboratory's own LOI procedure as well as a standardised LOI procedure to analyse three different sediments. The range of LOI values between laboratories measured at 550 °C was generally larger when each laboratory used its own method than when using the standard method. This was similar for 950 °C, although the range of values tended to be smaller. The within-laboratory range of LOI measurements for a given sediment was generally small. Comparisons of the results of the individual and the standardised method suggest that there is a laboratory-specific pattern in the results, probably due to differences in laboratory equipment and/or handling that could not be eliminated by standardising the LOI procedure. Factors such as sample size, exposure time, position of samples in the furnace and the laboratory measuring affected LOI results, with LOI at 550 °C being more susceptible to these factors than LOI at 950 °C. We, therefore, recommend analysts to be consistent in the LOI method used in relation to the ignition temperatures, exposure times, and the sample size and to include information on these three parameters when referring to the method.},

These variables included Beggiatoa cover, pellets and faeces, sediment colour, and abundance of flora and fauna. Analysis of the data by multivariate statistics indicated that quantitative data from video recordings can clearly detect major organic enrichment, but that they are not as sensitive as benthic infaunal data to lower levels of disturbance.

abstract = {Kelp forests are phyletically diverse, structurally complex and highly productive components of cold- water rocky marine coastlines. This paper reviews the conditions in which kelp forests develop globally and where, why and at what rate they become deforested. The ecology and long archaeological history of kelp forests are examined through case studies from southern California, the Aleutian Islands and the western North Atlantic, well-studied locations that represent the widest possible range in kelp forest biodi- versity. Global distribution of kelp forests is physiologically constrained by light at high latitudes and by nutrients, warm temperatures and other macrophytes at low latitudes. Within mid-latitude belts (roughly 40–60° latitude in both hemispheres) well-developed kelp forests are most threatened by herbivory, usually from sea urchins. Overfishing and extirpation of highly valued vertebrate apex predators often triggered herbivore population increases, leading to widespread kelp deforestation. Such deforestations have the most profound and lasting impacts on species-depauperate systems, such as those in Alaska and the western North Atlantic. Globally urchin-induced deforestation has been increasing over the past 2–3 decades. Continued fishing down of coastal food webs has resulted in shifting harvesting targets from apex predators to their invertebrate prey, including kelp-grazing herbivores. The recent global expansion of sea urchin harvesting has led to the wide- spread extirpation of this herbivore, and kelp forests have returned in some locations but, for the first time, these forests are devoid of vertebrate apex predators. In the western North Atlantic, large predatory crabs have recently filled this void and they have become the new apex predator in this system. Similar shifts from fish-to crab-dominance may have occurred in coastal zones of the United Kingdom and Japan, where large predatory finfish were extirpated long ago. Three North American case studies of kelp forests were examined to determine their long history with humans and project the status of future kelp forests to the year 2025. Fishing impacts on kelp forest systems have been both profound and much longer in duration than previously thought. Archaeological data suggest that coastal peoples exploited kelp forest organisms for thousands of years, occasionally resulting in localized losses of apex predators, outbreaks of sea urchin popu- lations and probably small-scale deforestation. Over the past two centuries, commercial exploitation for export led to the extirpation of sea urchin predators, such as the sea otter in the North Pacific and predatory fishes like the cod in the North Atlantic. The large- scale removal of predators for export markets increased sea urchin abundances and promoted the decline of kelp forests over vast areas. Despite southern California having one of the longest known associations with coastal kelp forests, widespread deforestation is rare. It is possible that functional redundancies among predators and herbivores make this most diverse system most stable. Such biodiverse kelp forests may also resist invasion from non-native species. In the species-depauperate western North Atlantic, introduced algal competitors carpet the benthos and threaten future kelp dominance. There, other non-native herbivores and predators have become established and dominant components of this system. Climate changes have had measurable impacts on kelp forest ecosystems and efforts to control the emission of greenhouse gasses should be a global priority. However, overfishing appears to be the greatest manageable threat to kelp forest ecosystems over the 2025 time horizon. Management should focus on minimizing fishing impacts and restoring populations of functionally important species in these systems.},

Invertebrate abundance is particularly high in the kelp holdfasts and associated with epiphytes on the stipes. We investigated colonisation patterns of this fauna on artificial substrata (holdfast and epiphyte mimics) exposed for short time periods in the kelp forest in two seasons, summer and late autumn. Within 7 days, 99 taxa common on natural kelp substratum colonised the artificial substrata in large numbers, demonstrating high mobility and indicating that there may be a rapid exchange of individuals and species among algae. Gastropods and amphipods were the most abundant colonisers. In summer, a specific “epiphyte fauna” could be distinguished from a “holdfast fauna”, and species associated with epiphytes were significantly more abundant on the artificial substrata. Colonisation was more rapid in summer than in late autumn, which may be related to animal population density. The high dispersal rate can facilitate the interaction with other communities and with higher trophic levels in the kelp-forest food web.},

abstract = {Propagule dispersal in seaweeds is a process influenced by a variety of biological and physical factors, the complexity of which has hindered efforts to understand colonization, persistence, post-disturbance recovery, and dynamics of algal populations in general. In view of this limitation, we employ here modifications to an existing turbulent- transport model to explore the mechanics of nearshore macroalgal spore dispersal and its relationship to coastal hydrodynamic conditions. Our modeling efforts focus on four ex- ample species of seaweed whose reproductive propagules span a wide range in sinking speed and height of release above the sea floor: the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, the erect fucoid Sargassum muticum, the small filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus, and the flaccid red alga Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii. Results indicate that both propagule sinking speed and release height can affect dispersal distance substantially, but that the influence of these biological parameters is modulated strongly by the intensity of turbulence as dictated by waves and currents. In rapid flows with larger waves, it is primarily fluid dynamic processes, in particular current velocities, that determine dispersal distance. Ad- ditional simulations suggest that patterns of spore dispersal are highly skewed, with most propagules encountering the sea floor within a few meters to hundreds of meters of their parents, but with a sizeable fraction of spores also dispersing as far as kilometers. Such model predictions imply a much greater potential for longer range dispersal than has typ- ically been assumed, a finding with important implications for understanding the demo- graphics of algal populations and for predicting levels of connectivity among them.

abstract = {Intra-specific morphological variability is common among many species of plants, and is particularly common among marine algae. Populations of the kelp Egregia menziesii (Turner) Areschoug are known to be extremely variable in form, and variability in this species is well-correlated with geographical distribution. Populations north of Point Conception, California, are characterized by individuals having thick, tough, wide stipes and small blades, whereas populations south of Point Conception are characterized by individuals having thin, smooth stipes and large blades. Point Conception (hereafter PC) is a well-known biogeographic boundary for many marine species. The region north of PC is typified by cold, nutrient-rich water favorable to plant growth, but also by high wave exposure, increasing the likelihood of plant breakage or dislodgement. The region south of PC is characterized by warmer, oligotrophic water (less favorable for plant growth), but the potential for plant breakage or dislodgment is low due to the calm seas in this region. Using reciprocal transplant experiments, we examined the potential adaptive value of the morphologies of both populations (northern and southern) in the light of these physical gradients among sites north and south of PC, and the tradeoff between rapid growth and increased risk of breakage. We reciprocally transplanted northern- and southern-form E. menziesii among several sites north and south of PC and monitored size and survival of each individual over a 5 mo period. In general, both survival and growth of the northern form was greatest at the northern sites, and southern form survival and growth was greatest at the southern sites. Overall, growth was greatest at the northern sites, and the greatest increase in size was achieved by a southern-form individual at a northern site. These results indicate that regionally specific morphological forms of E. menziesii seem to be uniquely adapted to maximize growth and survival under conditions typical of their native region. However, in the absence of breakage, southern-form E. menziesii have the potential to grow large under northern conditions. Northern-form E. menziesii have a reduced probability of breakage or dislodgment due to their high-strength, low-drag morphology. Southern-form E. menziesii have much lower breaking strengths and higher drag than northern forms, but have a higher surface area per unit of stipe, potentially advantageous for nutrient uptake in the low-nutrient environment south of Point Conception. Although these morphological forms appear to be advantageous within each of these regions, it remains to be explored whether their morphology can be altered at an early life stage or whether it is genetically fixed.},

Over a 12 yr period (1988 to 1999), 30 043 lobsters were tagged at 5 sites. From west to east, these were Cape Agulhas, West and East Agulhas Bank, Mossel Bay to Port Elizabeth, and Port Alfred.

Overall, 547 (25.8{\%}) tagged lobsters of both sexes moved {\textgreater}20 km within or between sites. We hypothesized that counter-current migration of juveniles would occur to redress downstream dispersal of phyllosoma larvae by the westerly flowing Agulhas Current.

The Cape Agulhas population (at the western extreme) comprised juveniles only. Over 97{\%} migrated {\textgreater}50 km, either southeastwards offshore to the West and East Agulhas Bank sites (106 lobsters, covering a mean distance of 154 km), or eastwards alongshore to the Mossel Bay to Port Elizabeth site near the center of the range (33 lobsters, 461 km). The fastest 5{\%} of migrants moved at 0.43 to 0.78 km d–1. In general, Cape Agulhas migrants reached West Agulhas Bank within 1 yr, East Agulhas Bank within 2, and Mossel Bay to Port Elizabeth within 3 yr. The West Agulhas Bank population comprised mostly juveniles and small mature individuals, and 38{\%} migrated, all moving eastwards, either to East Agulhas Bank (66 lobsters, 46 km), or to Mossel Bay to Port Elizabeth (73 lobsters, 426 km). The easterly migration of P. gilchristi was evident but diminished at East Agulhas Bank, virtually absent at Mossel Bay to Port Elizabeth and non-existent at Port Alfred (at the eastern extreme). There was no evidence suggesting a westwards or return migration at any of the 5 sites. It is concluded that Cape Agulhas is an important settlement area for post-larvae originating between Port Elizabeth and West Agulhas Bank, and that juveniles migrate eastwards to redress the downstream displacement. The Port Alfred population is non-migratory and receives no immigrants from elsewhere, adding to other evidence that it is a separate stock, and it is inferred that phyllosoma larvae from this area use a different larval dispersal and return mechanism.},

abstract = {Environmental toxicology has been and continues to be an important discipline (e.g., single-species testing for screening purposes). However, ecological toxicology (ecotoxicology - more realism in tests, test species and exposures) is required for predicting real world effects and for site-specific assessments. Ecotoxicology and ecology have shown similar developmental patterns over time; closer cooperation between ecologists and toxicologists would benefit both disciplines. Ecology can be incorporated into toxicology either extrinsically (separately, e.g., providing information on pre-selected test species) or intrinsically (e.g., as part of test species selection) - the latter is preferable. General guidelines for acute and chronic testing and criteria for species selection differ for ecotoxicology and environmental toxicology, and are outlined. An overall framework is proposed based on ecological risk assessment (ERA), for combining ecology and toxicology (environmental and ecological) for decision-making. Increased emphasis on ecotoxicology represents a shift from reductionist to holistic approaches. Copyright ?? 2002 .},

abstract = {In general, individuals who survive to reproduce have genotypes that work relatively well under local conditions. Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

abstract = {Almost all juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae shelter beneath the urchin Parechinus angulosus. Field observations showed that all juvenile abalone remained concealed under urchins by day. Even by night, only 10-25{\%} left the protection of urchins to forage. Offered a choice of rocks or urchins in tide pools, the juveniles strongly preferred urchins rather than rocks. In aquaria, both urchins and abalone were active only at night. The frequency with which juvenile abalone left shelter was greatest if rocks constituted the only form of concealment, intermediate when they sheltered under urchins alone and least when the urchins had access to drift kelp. The treatment that provided abalone with both urchins and drift kelp had the lowest rate of urchin movement and the highest microalgal benthic standing stocks, the gut contents of the abalone comprised mainly kelp and their gut fullness indices were higher than in the other treatments. Concealment of juvenile abalone beneath urchins evidently provides them with several benefits. First, when urchins trap drift kelp, the abalone are capable of feeding on it and enhance their uptake of food. Second, this behaviour reduces the frequency with which juvenile abalone leave the shelter of urchins. Third, urchins that trap drift kelp reduce their rates of movement and their consumption of benthic microalgae, and we speculate that this may improve feeding conditions for the early postsettlement "recruit" stages of H. midae, and reduce the risk of Urchins "bulldozing" them. Thus, for a complex of reasons, the dependency of P. angulosus on drift kelp provides benefits to abalone that would not exist if this urchin acted as a conventional grazer. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Phlorotannins (polyphenolic compounds) are found exclusively in brown algae and are commonly regarded as an important component of algal defense against herbivores. The variation in phlorotannin concentration within and among individual seaweed specimens of the same species can be substantial, and seaweeds may respond to herbivore damage by an increased production of phlorotannins in order to prevent further herbivory. In the present study, we investigated the natural variation of phlorotannins in different parts of the kelp Laminaria hyperborea in an observational field survey. We also performed a manipulative induction experiment in which we studied the effect of natural grazing by the patellid limpet Ansates (=Helcion) pellucida and the littorinid snail Lacuna vincta, as well as artificial damage on the production of phlorotannins in L. hyperborea. There was a large variation in phlorotannin content both among and within L. hyperborea individuals and populations. The control plants in the induction experiment had a higher phlorotannin content compared to plants in natural populations, but grazing by A. pellucida or L. vincta, or artificial damage did not induce a higher phlorotannin concentration in the kelps. Instead, the phlorotannin content in wounded kelps was significantly lower than in the control plants, possibly due to removal of phlorotannin-rich outer layers of the kelp thallus, or to an induced compensatory growth response in the L. hyperborea plants. These results imply that L. hyperborea phlorotannins probably do not function as an inducible chemical defense against A. pellucida and L. vincta, instead grazing by these herbivores decreases the phlorotannin content of the kelps.},

abstract = {Much current research on community ecology concerns indirect effects, cas- cading trophic interactions, and the role of top-down vs. bottom-up processes, as well as subsidization of matter and energy between different systems. We addressed all these topics by exploring interactions between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and both recruits and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, in the light of the fact that juvenile abalone shelter beneath the urchins. In field experiments at six sites, urchins were eliminated from removal plots to determine the degree to which juvenile abalone (individuals 3-35 mm in length) depend upon urchins. Comparisons were made with undisturbed and disturbance-control plots. We hypothesized that after removal of urchins: (1) there would be an immediate decline of juvenile abalone, since they are intimately associated with the urchins; (2) abalone recruits (recent settlers {\textless}3 mm in length) would be unlikely to suffer immediately or directly because, unlike juveniles, they are only weakly associated with the urchins; (3) foliar algae would proliferate due to decreased grazing by urchins; (4) there would be a consequent reduction in crustose coralline algae due to overgrowth by foliar algae; and (5) the decline of crustose corallines would reduce recruitment of abalone due to a loss of settlement and nursery habitat. In urchin-removal plots, juvenile abalone declined dramatically, becoming virtually extinct locally. Their disappearance was slowest in crevices compared with exposed habitats, but even there they failed to survive longer than five months. Contrary to expec- tations, abalone recruits also disappeared from urchin-removal plots, possibly because the cover of sediment almost doubled there. Also contrary to our hypotheses, neither foliar macroalgae nor encrusting corallines responded to urchin removal. The explanation of these results is that P. angulosus was able to gather drift kelp when this food source was available, rather than acting as an active grazer. This feeding pattern has profound consequences and explains why urchins failed to influence algal community composition. By sheltering be- neath urchins, juvenile abalone gain protection from predators and may also benefit from an enhanced food supply. Bottom-up subsidization of urchins by drift kelp is thus respon- sible for the feeding behavior of the urchins, and indirectly facilitates their role in harboring juvenile abalone. This role is of immense importance for the lucrative abalone fishery, and depletion of urchins could lead to a collapse of abalone populations. Human exploitation of top predators that consume urchins, such as rock lobsters and some fishes, has conceivably exaggerated the role of urchins in sustaining juven},

An important component of the management process is the establishment of a monitoring program to quantify the biological assemblages present and to detect any human impacts to these assemblages if they occur. This study has successfully established a quantitative baseline dataset on the horizontal and vertical distribution of invertebrate and algal assemblages within Bathurst Channel for use in on-going monitoring of change in the system. Robust estimates of the abundance of most conspicuous species have been obtained at selected sensitive sites (usually on hard substrates), allowing future changes and impacts to be detected and quantified. By utilising a combination of comprehensive quantitative surveys throughout the system and detailed habitat mapping, our understanding of the biological zonation within the system has been enhanced, along with our understanding of the limited extent of habitat available to many of the unique invertebrate assemblages.},

abstract = {Replicated ecological studies in marine reserves and associated unprotected areas are valuable in examining top-down impacts on communities and the ecosystem-level effects of fishing. We carried out experimental in two temperate marine reserves to examine these top-down influences on shallow subtidal reef communities in northeastern New Zealand. Both reserves examined are known to support high densities of predators and tethering experiments showed that the chance of predation on the dominant sea urchin, Evechinus chloroticus, within both reserves was approximately 7 times higher relative to outside. Predation was most intense on the smallest size class (30-40 mm) of tethered urchins, the size at which urchins cease to exhibit cryptic behaviour. A high proportion of predation on large urchins could be attributed to the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Predation on the smaller classes was probably by both lobsters and predatory fish, predominantly the sparid Pagrus auratus. The density of adult Evechinus actively razing the substratum in the urchin barrens habitat was found to be significantly lower at marine reserve sites (2.2+/-0.3 m(-2)) relative to non-reserve sites (5.5+/-0.4 m(-2)). There was no difference in the density of cryptic juveniles between reserve and non-reserve sites. Reserve populations were more bimodal, with urchins between 40 and 55 mm occurring at very low numbers. Experimental removal of Evechinus from the urchin barrens habitat over 12 months lead to a change from a crustose coralline algal habitat to a macroalgal dominated habitat. Such macroalgal habitats were found to be more extensive in both reserves, where urchin densities were lower, relative to the adjacent unprotected areas that were dominated by urchin barrens. The patterns observed provide evidence for a top-down role of predators in structuring shallow reef communities in northeastern New Zealand and demonstrate how marine reserves can reverse the indirect effects of fishing and re-establish community-level trophic cascades.},

abstract = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The spatial distribution of genetic markers can be useful both in estimating patterns of gene flow and in reconstructing biogeographic history, particularly when gene genealogies can be estimated. Genealogies based on nonrecombining genetic units such as mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA often consist of geographically separated clades that come into contact in narrow regions. Such phylogeographic breaks are usually assumed to be the result of long-term barriers to gene flow. Here I show that deep phylogeographic breaks can form within a continuously distributed species even when there are no barriers to gene flow. The likelihood of observing phylogeographic breaks increases as the average individual dispersal distance and population size decrease. Those molecular markers that are most likely to show evidence of real geographic barriers are also most likely to show phylogeographic breaks that formed without any barrier to gene flow. These results might provide an explanation as to why some species, such as the greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides), have phylogeographic breaks in mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA that do not coincide with sudden changes in other traits.},

abstract = {The present study combines methods that were designed to infer intraspecific relationships (e.g. nested-clade analysis (NCA), mismatch distributions and maximum likelihood gene flow analysis) to analyse historic events and recurrent processes in the cryptic mud snail species Hydrobia acuta and H. glyca. Specifically, we test the proposed allopatry of cryptic species and whether the peculiar range-subdivision of the putative subspecies H. a. acuta and H. a. neglecta is a result of long-distance dispersal or continuous range expansion. The NCA indicates a past fragmentation of the two H. acuta subspecies as well as past fragmentations within H. glyca. Gene-flow analyses show extensive gene flow in an E-W direction (towards the Atlantic) in the Mediterranean H. a. acuta, generally low gene flow in a W-E direction in the Atlantic H. a. neglecta and complex gene-flow pattern in a N-S but also in a S-N direction (against the Gulf Stream) in H. glyca. Based on these data and supportive ecological and oceanographical data, we hypothesize that the separation of the two H. acuta subspecies was not caused by long-distance dispersal but by a range shift and/or range expansion of the closely related competitor H. glyca as a result of an interglacial warming with a subsequent range shift in H. acuta. Moreover, our data do not show evidence for a long-term, stable sympatry of Hydrobia species, supporting the concept of allopatric relationships within cryptic radiations. NCA and gene-flow analyses indicate that the only sympatric population found in our study is the result of a recent dispersal event from the nearby Mediterranean. It is assumed that allopatric relationships in ephemeral Hydrobia populations constitute an evolutionary advantage relative to competition, recruitment and re-establishment of habitats. Mechanisms that could be of relevance for maintaining allopatry are discussed.},

abstract = {Little is known about the cumulative effects of multiple ({\textgreater}2) environmental controls on species performance and interactions in aquatic ecosystems. We asked how changes in climatic (temperature, ultraviolet radiation) and ecological controls (nutrients, grazing) affect recruitment of the green macroalga Enteromorpha intestinalis, which forms destructive algal blooms in coastal ecosystems worldwide. We designed factorial laboratory experiments to analyze the recruitment response to (1) single and combined effects of nutrient enrichment, grazing pressure, and grazer species composition and (2) the cumulative effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, temperature, nutrients, and grazing. Recruitment of E. intestinalis increased exponentially with nutrient enrichment. Grazers could control algal recruitment until a nutrient threshold was reached depending on grazer species composition. Snails (Littorina littorea) had strong negative effects on recruit density, whereas amphipods (Gammarus oceanicus) had weak grazing effects and favored algal recruitment through excretion when nutrient supply was low. Temperature and nutrients both enhanced algal recruitment but also the effects of grazers, which led to a significant three-way interaction among these factors. Similarly, effects of UV radiation depended on grazer presence and temperature. When grazers were absent, UV radiation reduced recruitment at 11 and 17°C but enhanced recruitment at 5°C. No effects were seen in the presence of grazers. Our results indicate that multiple human influences, such as climate change, eutrophication, and food web alterations, have interdependent effects and the potential for synergistically enhancing the development of macroalgal blooms in coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {The strength of interactions between predators and their prey (interaction strength) varies enormously among species within ecological communities. Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions may be more stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported log-normal distributions of per capita interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator-prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments were used to determine maximum per capita interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that maximum per capita interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted maximum per capita interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting distribution of per capita interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had per capita interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities.},

abstract = {In proximity of shelters, grazing by sea urchins plays a fundamental role in establishing and maintaining areas dominated by encrusting corallines. Much attention has been given to the effects of urchins on algal assemblages in shallow subtidal reefs, but few studies attempted to clarify the role played by encrusting coralline algae in this system. It has been shown that encrusting corallines are able to reduce settlement of potential competitors, suggesting that they do not rely on grazing by herbivores to prevent swamping by erect algal species. In shallow subtidal reefs of the Mediterranean Sea, the sea urchins Para centrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula are the main herbivores, whose grazing commonly leads to a mosaic of areas dominated alternatively by encrusting corallines and turf-forming algae. This study aims to separate the effects of urchins and encrusting corallines on the re-colonisation of encrusting coralline-dominated patches (barren habitat) by surrounding erect algal species (turf-forming algae). Different hypotheses were tested by means of multivariate and univariate analyses. The multivariate hypothesis was that the algal assemblage developing when encrusting corallines and urchins are simultaneously removed would be more similar to that establishing in stands of turf-forming algae, than that developing when none or only 1 of the 2 factors is manipulated. The univariate hypotheses tested were: (1) that there is a negative effect of sea urchins and encrusting corallines on the re-colonisation of barren areas by surrounding turf-forming algal species and (2) that the effects of encrusting corallines are weaker than those of urchins, but that they operate in the same direction. These hypotheses were tested by means of an orthogonal manipulation of urchins and encrusting corallines. At each of 3 study sites, 2 replicate barren patches were assigned to each of these treatments: (1) +corallines+urchins; (2) +corallines-urchins; (3) -corallines+urchins; (4) -corallines-urchins. The results suggest that the occurrence of areas dominated by encrusting corallines on shallow subtidal reefs in the northwest Mediterranean is not simply the result of grazing by sea urchins on turf-forming species. The removal of encrusting corallines also affected the abundance of dominant algal species and determined the development of an algal assemblage resembling those occurring within stands of algal turfs. The effects of the removal of urchins on turf-forming species were generally positive, while those of encrusting corallines varied from negative (Padina pavonica) to positive (Acetabularia acetabulum and filamentous algae). Therefore, the role played by encrusting corallines in maintaining alternative habitats on shallow subtidal reefs should be taken into account, thus avoiding the overestimation of the effects of grazing by sea urchins.},

abstract = {Kelp beds are thought to provide a refuge for a variety of marine organisms by damping waves, changing hydrodynamic flow, offering substrata for epiphytic species, and altering the abundances of predators and prey. At the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands, a typical flow-through system, kelp beds have the potential of acting as a prime habitat for a variety of pelagic species that would otherwise be swept away and lost from the island ecosystem. The current study investigates the effects of kelp beds on the abundance and composition of zooplankton and microphytoplankton, with the main aim of determining whether kelp beds act as a repository for larval stages in general, and for the swimming prawn, Nauticaris marionis, in particular. Salinity gradients created by freshwater run-off indicated that kelp beds at Marion Island retain surface water and restrict water exchange with the open ocean. Both the abundance and diversity of zooplankton were greatest within the kelp beds. This was partially due to the high abundance of kelp-associated species, but also to the apparent retention of naupliar larvae within the kelp canopy. Unlike the larvae of ostracods and copepods, caridean zoeae were rare, indicating that kelp beds are not a prime habitat for larvae of N. marionis. The larval retention mechanism for this species, therefore, remains unknown. Apart from retaining water and certain species of zooplankton, chlorophyll a/phaeopigment ratios confirmed the existence of a substantial detrital pool within the kelp beds. This retention of detritus may explain the observed importance of kelp-derived matter in the diet of many nearshore animals. In contrast to the zooplankton, kelp beds seemed to have little effect on the abundance and composition of microphytoplankton, and chlorophyll a values were low at all stations.},

abstract = {At Danger Point, South Africa, mariculture of the abalone Haliotis midae has led to increased demand for freshly harvested kelp Ecklonia maxima. This study estimates the biomass of E. maxima available for harvesting, investi- gates the effects of harvesting on the recovery of kelp and on the benthic understorey biota, and tests an alternative method of harvesting kelp by cutting off only fronds rather than whole plants. Estimates from diver sampling between May 1992 and November 1994 and infra-red maps indicate an E. maxima biomass at Danger Point of 22 973 tons fresh mass in 336 ha of kelp beds, insufficient to sustain projected abalone feed requirements in the area if harvesting is done in the traditional manner of cutting the stipes. However, sufficient frond material may be harvested sustainably if only fronds are cut, at distances 20–30 cm from the bases of fronds. Cutting at 10 cm from the base significantly reduced regrowth rates, and there was little regrowth after cutting at 2 cm. Yield per unit effort was higher for a four-month interval between harvesting them for one-, two- and three-month intervals. Two years after harvesting whole plants (in two 100 × 20 m lanes), biomass and density of kelp had recovered (similar in control and harvested lanes), and there were no detectable differences in the understorey communities, as measured by detrended correspondence analysis. Although harvesting of whole kelp has a minimal effect on the understorey biota and kelp itself recovers within two years, selective cutting of fronds allows plants to remains alive and produce a higher yield. This method is likely to minimize damage to the kelp bed system.},

Distrurbance is defined as the total or partial loss of biomass from an area by causes other than senescence (Chapman and Johnson 1990). Therefore, harvesting is a type of disturbance that may alter the structure and dynamics of kelp beds. This study aimed were to estimate the potential harvest of E. maxima at Danger Point, and to assess the consequences of harvesting whole sporophytes on kelp recruitment, regrowth, and the understorey community.

Disturbance has been shown to increase diversity (Chapman and Johnson 1990), and this was seen at one site in this study, in the harvested lanes. Disturbance reduces more space for settlement, which results in decreased inter-specific competition. However, species diversity decreased after harvesting at the other site, and therefore the change in diversity may be unrelated to harvesting. 

Danger point showed low recruitment between November 1992 and November 1993, followed by significantly higher but variable densities for he rest of the study period. This indicates long-term or stochastic patterns. The episodic nature of kelp recruitment is well documented. E. Maxima appears to be adapted to disturbance because of the high spore output, and the gametophytes, and juvenile sporophytes grow rapidly. 

The authors concluded that density of E. maxima at this site seems to be determined by grazing and availability of primary space on the substratum. In this case, grazers seem to have a controlling effect on the density of the young kelp sporophytes at Danger Point. A past study by Fricke 1979 showed that urchin removal lead to increased kelp recruitment. However, in another study by Day (1998) found that, in the same area, urchin removals had negligible effect on algae, including kelp sporelings. In this study, high recruitment was present at both sites, and most of the juveniles were located in Refugio provided by kelp holdfasts. 

The present study showed that, at Danger Point, the kelp bed recovered from harvesting in about two years, in terms of biomass and kelp density. Understorey communities were essentially unchanged two years after harvesting, and showed no visual signs of change at any stage.

abstract = {We tested the view that few generalizations are possible about the structure of subtidal algae assemblages and that the situation worsens or does not change as more sites are examined. We quantified the percentage cover of 4 morphological groups of benthic algae (encrusting and articu- lated coralline algae, and foliose and turfing algae) under canopies of kelp Ecklonia radiata and in areas without kelp (macroalgae {\textgreater}4 cm high). This was repeated over 4 spatial scales ranging from quadrats (separated by 10s of m), sites (separated by km), locations (separated by 100s of km) to regions (separated by 1000s of km) across the southern coastline of Australia: Western Australia (WA), Southern Australia (SA) and Eastern Australia (EA). The key result was that while comparison among sites revealed substantial and often inconsistent variation in abundance of benthic algae between habitats (kelp vs open), clear patterns emerged when locations and regions were compared. In EA, where grazers are effective in maintaining extensive areas of encrusting corallines, patterns of algal cover between habitats (kelp vs open) were generally reversed to WA and SA, where grazers are sub- stantially less effective. These results indicate a large distinction in the ecology of these regions (WA = SA ≠ EA) and how lack of understanding of this pattern at the regional scale tends to suggest overwhelming variation when single studies are compared among regions. These differences also highlight that comparisons of studies done at small scales, even if done at several sites in a locality, provide a difficult basis to understand the generality of pattern in algal assemblage structure due to large variation at this scale. While we acknowledge that these broad patterns were not possible to validate at the scale of sites, it was possible to increase the scale of observation to encompass broader patterns that might be organized around a relatively simple set of ecological predictions},

abstract = {Kelp beds are thought to provide a refuge for a variety of marine organisms by damping waves, changing hydrodynamic flow, offering substrata for epiphytic species, and altering the abundances of predators and prey. At the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands, a typical flow-through system, kelp beds have the potential of acting as a prime habitat for a variety of pelagic species that would otherwise be swept away and lost from the island ecosystem. The current study investigates the effects of kelp beds on the abundance and composition of zooplankton and microphytoplankton, with the main aim of determining whether kelp beds act as a repository for larval stages in general, and for the swimming prawn, Nauticaris marionis, in particular. Salinity gradients created by freshwater run-off indicated that kelp beds at Marion Island retain surface water and restrict water exchange with the open ocean. Both the abundance and diversity of zooplankton were greatest within the kelp beds. This was partially due to the high abundance of kelp-associated species, but also to the apparent retention of naupliar larvae within the kelp canopy. Unlike the larvae of ostracods and copepods, caridean zoeae were rare, indicating that kelp beds are not a prime habitat for larvae of N. marionis. The larval retention mechanism for this species, therefore, remains unknown. Apart from retaining water and certain species of zooplankton, chlorophyll a/phaeopigment ratios confirmed the existence of a substantial detrital pool within the kelp beds. This retention of detritus may explain the observed importance of kelp-derived matter in the diet of many nearshore animals. In contrast to the zooplankton, kelp beds seemed to have little effect on the abundance and composition of microphytoplankton, and chlorophyll a values were low at all stations.},

abstract = {Using trained observers and video images of reef transects from many parts of the Great Barrier Reef, we investigated (1) accuracy of classification of benthos and (2) variability contributed by observers to the precision of estimates of benthic cover obtained from video tapes. In order to estimate accuracy of identification, benthic organisms were identified twice, first in the field and later from video images. These identifications were then compared. The effect of observer error on precision of benthic cover estimates was examined by having 2 observers sample the same video images on 3 separate occasions. These estimates were then compared at the level of different benthic groups (hard coral, soft coral and algae) and for different hierarchical levels of classification of hard corals (life form, family, genus and species). 'Benthic groups' (mean accuracy of 90 +/- 8{\%}) and 'families of hard coral' (91 +/- 7{\%}) were identified most accurately and least variably from video images, although many genera and some distinctive species were also identified reliably. Life forms of hard corals proved to be the least accurate and most variable level of classification, with a mean accuracy rating of 74 +/- 16{\%}. There was little additional variation in estimates of cover when 2 trained observers sampled images, compared with variation in estimates of cover from repeated samples of images by a single observer. At 10{\%} cover, variability in estimates made by a single observer resulted in mean CIs of 7.9 to 12.1{\%}. Inclusion of variation between observers expanded CIs by only +/-0.22{\%}. Furthermore, total observer error was small relative to estimates of cover. For example, at 30{\%} cover, the mean Cl due to both between- and within-observer variability was 27.2 to 32.8{\%}.},

In northern Chile a stretch of 600 km of coastline showed massive mortality of the intertidal kelp species Lessonia nigrescens Bory, of which only a few individuals managed to survive. Kelps and their associated biodiversity recovered but kelp beds re- colonization in general was variable in time and space seemingly very slow along northern Chilean coasts. Here we show, effectively, that northward re- colonization advanced less than 60 km in 20 years. Conversely, kelp beds of the Northern Hemisphere recovered 300 km in only six months after the same ENSO event. Genetic diversity in the two most af- fected populations of L. nigrescens shows half of the heterozygosity and polymorphism with respect to that observed in six non affected populations. In ad- dition, geographically separated populations seem highly isolated as evidenced by high and significant fixation indices (all F ST values over 0.4).},

Exploitation of the kelp habitat by the fauna, and the ways in which habitat size and seasonal variations a¡ect the kelp fauna community were analysed. The study focused on mobile macrofauna, of which 238 species were found on 56 kelps sampled, with an average density of almost 8000 individuals per kelp. Amphipods and gastropods were the most diverse and abundant fauna groups. The species composition was di¡erent on the lamina, stipe (with epiphytic algae) and holdfast. A similar pattern of epiphyte- and holdfast-fauna composition was found for all regions. Lowest diversity and abundance were found on the lamina, and highest diversity in the holdfast. Highest abundance was found on the stipe in summer, but there were large variations between sites and seasons, from a few individuals to more than 80 000 animals per stipe. Neither seasonal changes nor variation in habitat volume a¡ected the number of species signi¢cantly, but abundance was signi¢cantly related to season and habitat volume. These variations were most pronounced for stipe fauna. Laminaria hyperborea o¡ers a heterogeneous habitat exploited by a diverse and abundant invertebrate community, its abundance depending on local and regional variations in kelp size. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {We carried out experiments in a wave tank using a factorial design (in the presence and absence of waves and kelp blades) to evaluate the impact of water motion, and of wave-induced movement of kelp blades, on (1) movement of the predatory sea star Asterias vulgaris towards its prey, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, and (2) on its success in capturing its prey. The wave tank mimicked the back-and-forth flow caused by waves. The displacement of the sea stars was 2 times greater in the absence than in the presence of waves. Movements of A. vulgaris were more directed towards the prey under back-and-forth water movement than under still conditions. The presence of kelp blades without waves also reduced the movement of sea stars towards prey as the sea stars largely stayed in the portion of the tank without kelp. Sea stars only became detached in treatments with waves, and a greater proportion detached when both waves and kelp were present. The success rate of sea stars in capturing mussels was null in the treatment with both waves and kelp. These observations support the hypothesis that the kelp canopy in shallow water, and movement of the kelp blades by waves, provide mussels with a spatial refuge from sea star predation. We show for the first time that a sea star can use distance chemodectection to localize prey under conditions of back-and-forth flow.},

abstract = {Diet vertical migration (DVM) by zooplankton is a universal feature in all the World's oceans, as well as being common in freshwater environments. The normal pattern involves movement from shallow depths at night to greater depths during the day. For many herbivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton that feed predominantly near the surface on phytoplankton and microzooplankton, minimising the risk of predation from fish seems to be the ultimate factor behind DVM. These migrants appear to use deep water as a dark daytime refuge where their probability of being detected and eaten is lower than if they remained near the surface. Associated with these vertical movements of mesozooplankton, predators at higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, birds and reptiles, may modify their behaviour to optimise the exploitation of their vertically migrating prey. Recent advances in biotelemetry promise to allow the interaction between migrating zooplankton and diving air-breathing vertebrates to be explored in far more detail than hitherto.},

abstract = {Two species of rock lobster (Palinuridae) are commonly found in coastal waters around both New Zealand and Australia. Both species have a relatively long larval phase, which raises the question of how populations can be maintained in regions where the mean flow advects larvae away from the coast. Previous work shows that Jasus edwardsii is genetically indistinguishable between Australia and New Zealand, whereas Sagmariasus verreauxi may be genetically different between the 2 countries. Satellite altimeter data are used here to test the hypothesis that Australia acts as a source of larvae for some New Zealand populations, and to investigate if there is a physical mechanism for the apparent lack of gene flow for S. verreauxi. A Lagrangian approach is used in which the western Tasman Sea is seeded with numerical drifters to build up a statistical summary of the likely distribution of larval trajectories. Ignoring biological factors, about 9{\%} of J. edwardsii and about 2{\%} of S. verreauxi larvae might be expected to arrive in New Zealand waters within their respective larval lifetimes. An order-of-magnitude estimate shows that even with extremely high mortality, these rates are high enough for trans-Tasman larval flow to contribute to and possibly maintain some New Zealand populations. Larval flow across the Tasman Sea should be sufficient to maintain trans- Tasman genetic homogeneity in both species. We suggest that 1 reason that S. verreauxi may not be genetically homogenous is that in order to arrive in New Zealand within 1 larval lifetime, they have to cross the Tasman Sea north of the productive Subtropical Front where there is not enough prey to sustain them},

abstract = {Abstract. Genetic analyses of marine population structure often find only slight geographic differentiation in species with high dispersal potential. Interpreting the significance of this slight genetic signal has been difficult because even mild genetic structure implies very limited demographic exchange between populations, but slight differentiation could also be due to sampling error. Examination of genetic isolation by distance, in which close populations are more similar than distant ones, has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one-dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2–5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25–150 km. Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves, whether reserves will be self-seeding, whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas, and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system, but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well. $\backslash$nKey words: connectivity; dispersal; isolation by distance; larvae; population structure.},

abstract = {This review provides an overview of the importance of beach accumulations of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmacrophytes and other organic beach-cast material on the ecology of sandy beach ecosystems. It$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndescribes the composition of these allochthonous subsidies, their abundance on beaches in relation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto seasonal, lunar, tidal and spatial trends, their decomposition and utilisation by bacterial,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmeio- and macrofaunal communities. The paper then analyses the community structure and the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nspecies succession in both macrophyte wrack and carrion and reports the most important findings$\backslash$r$\backslash$non individual wrack-inhabiting species (amphipods, isopods, dipterans). Other aspects,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsuch as feeding and microclimatic preferences of certain species and their interactions in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwracks, are also discussed. Links to vertebrate species and other secondary consumers that$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexploit beach-cast macrophytes and carrion as trophic resource are considered, and the importance$\backslash$r$\backslash$nof wrack in recycling nutrients to nearshore coastal ecosystems is stressed. The beneficial$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand detrimental effects of organic beach-cast material on both plants and animals of beach and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nnearshore communities and on the geomorphology of coastal beach-dune systems are pointed$\backslash$r$\backslash$nout. Another section is dedicated to human use of beach-cast macrophytes through harvesting of$\backslash$r$\backslash$neconomically important species and of other stranded material through its exploitation for traditional$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreasons. The effects of harvesting on local faunal communities and on the stability of the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndunes is discussed. A final section of the paper includes the positive and negative effects of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nman-made debris on sandy-beach ecosystems and briefly reviews the major findings.},

abstract = {We present observations and experimental results supporting the view that macroalgal morphology can represent a balance between maximizing photosynthetic ability and limiting susceptibility of the thallus to mechanical damage. The relationships among morphology, water flow, and photosynthesis were examined for five algal species representing three functional forms of marine macroalgae at Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. The relationship between surface area/volume ratio (SA/V) and rates of biomass-specific net photosynthesis (NP) across functional-form groups was examined to test the hypothesis that NP is related positively to SAN. The rate of NP increased with increasing SAN across functional groups. This relationship then was examined within a functional group for two species, Dictyopteris undulata and, Zonaria farlowii, which are morphologically variable among sites. Flow measurements and morphometric analysis of thalli of D. undulata and Z farlowii at two wave-exposed and two wave-protected sites indicated that intraspecific morphological variation corresponded to variation in wave exposure. A field experiment that manipulated rates of flow in situ resulted in morphological changes in D. undulata and Z. farlowii, indicating that water motion was responsible for the observed morphological plasticity. To examine the interaction between morphology and water flow on algal physiology, NP was estimated for morphotypes of D. undulata and Z farlowii from wave-exposed and wave-protected sites. At saturating photon flux densities, NP was affected significantly by flow speed, particularly for morphotypes from the wave-protected site. For these morphotypes, increased flow speeds resulted in sustained, then decreased NP as flow speeds exceeded 17 cm/s, suggesting that water flow may affect NP at low flow speeds by mitigating mass transfer limitation and at high flow speeds by changing light interception and flow within the compacted thallus. The plasticity of morphologies and the interaction of these morphotypes with, flow may represent a trade-off between maximizing NP and reducing the susceptibility of the thallus to mechanical damage and/or dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces.},

abstract = {Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh kelp beds - a characteristic feature of the nearshore environment along the south-west Australian coastline - contribute significantly to the coastal biodiversity in temperate Australia, yet, little is known about the organization of these macroalgal assemblages. By compiling existing and new data sets from habitat surveys, we have characterized and compared the structure of kelp-associated macroalgal assemblages in three regions (Marmion Lagoon, Hamelin Bay and the marine environment neighbouring the Fitzgerald River National Park) across more than 1000 kilometres of the southwest Australian coastline. 152 macroalgal taxa had been recognized within the three regions and this is in the range of species richness reported from other Australian and African kelp beds. The kelp-associated algal assemblages were regionally distinct, 66{\%} of all taxa were only found in one region and only 17 taxa were found in all three regions. Adjacent regions shared an additional 13-15 taxa. The regional shifts in assemblage structure were evident in species composition of both canopy and understorey. The organization of assemblages followed a spatial hierarchy where differences in assemblage structure were larger among regions (hundreds of kilometres apart) than among sites within regions (kilometres apart) and differences among sites within region were larger than differences among quadrats within sites (metres apart). Despite this hierarchy each level of nesting contributed approximately the same to total variation in assemblage structure and these spatial patterns were stronger than temporal differences from seasons to 2-3 years. Our results suggest that local and small-scale processes contribute considerably to heterogeneity in macroalgal assemblages throughout south-western Australia, and, in particular, our results are consistent with E. radiata exerting a strong influence on macroalgal assemblage structure. Further, our study contradicts the existence of a general south-west Australian kelp assemblage, although a few species may form the core of E. radiata associations across regions.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

abstract = {Laminaria digitata is the dominant species of the dense, continuous kelp stands in the English Channel and on the Atlantic coasts of France, where it is harvested for its high quality algi- nates. However, in spite of its ecological and economic importance, our knowledge of the level and organisation of genetic diversity in this species is scant. Here, using comprehensive hierarchical sampling and 7 microsatellite loci, we explored the roles of dispersal strategies, current regimes and habitat discontinuities in shaping genetic structure of L. digitata populations. Our results show that continuous, non-fragmented forests of L. digitata were genetically differentiated at distances greater than 10 km, despite the absence of clear population boundaries. Furthermore, a pattern of isolation- by-distance indicated that gene flow occurred preferentially among adjacent populations following a stepping-stone model. In addition, we analysed the direction of migration using assignment tests and found that currents appeared to play a minor role in orienting gene flow, except in the Gulf of Saint Malo gyre. In contrast, habitat discontinuities were found to accentuate genetic differentiation and resulted in reduced genetic variation of isolated stands. In the context of a potential over-exploitation of kelp stands in Brittany, this study suggests that the existence of neighbouring populations can be vital to maintaining high levels of gene flow and thus, genetic diversity in this species.},

abstract = {Samples of kelp Laminaria hyperborea, various species of red algae, phytoplankton, material from sediment traps, invertebrates, fish and seabirds were collected on the west coast of Norway and the abundance of stable isotopes was analyzed. Canopy plants of L. hyperborea were most 13C depleted in spring and there was a significant difference between the basal ($\delta$13C: –16.65‰) and distal ($\delta$13C: –18.67‰) parts of the lamina. Young kelp plants were more 13C depleted (–23.59‰). The red algae fell into 2 groups: one in the same range as kelp plants ($\delta$13C: –18.93 to –22.27‰) and the other highly depleted ($\delta$13C: –32.85 to –34.38‰). Phytoplankton showed an average $\delta$13C value of –24.44‰. $\delta$15N values from L. hyperborea differed between the basal ($\delta$15N: 5.54‰) and distal ($\delta$15N: 3.54‰) part of lamina. $\delta$15N values for all primary producers values were in the range of 3.52 to 5.78‰. Among the gastropods, Helcion pellucida proved to be a kelp plant grazer, Lacuna vincta probably fed on both kelp and various species of red algae, whereas Aplysia punctata grazed ex- clusively on the most 13C-depleted red algae. $\delta$15N values for 2 other gastropods, Gibbula sp. and Calliostoma zizyphinum (8.64 and 10.30‰, respectively), suggest that they belong to higher trophic levels. Filter feeders occupied lower trophic levels and received variable carbon inputs from kelp. The only group of animals with $\delta$13C signals in the same range as phytoplankton were amphipods. Based on $\delta$15N values, the fish varied from intermediate to top consumers (trophic level: 2.6 to 3.3). Two species of seabirds were included in the study and their $\delta$15N values suggested 2 different trophic levels, which correspond to their known feeding preferences. A mixing model suggests that kelp-derived carbon plays an important role in this nearshore system and that kelp may serve as a carbon source for marine animals with several different types of feeding strategie},

abstract = {Using field and laboratory experiments, we investigated the relative ability of zygotes of three species of habitat-forming large brown algae from southern New Zealand to survive wave action and remain attached after settling times of 1, 6, and 12 h. Zygotes of Hormosira banksii (Turner) Decaisne and Cystophora torulosa (R. Brown) J. Agardh, intertidal algae common on sheltered and semi-protected shores in southern New Zealand, had between 24{\%} and 35{\%} survival 1 h after settlement and exposed to a single wave in the lab and field. In contrast, Durvillaea antarctica (Chamisso) Hariot, an exposed-shore species, had up to 75{\%} survival under the same conditions. Survival increased with post-settlement time for all three species. When given 6 h to attach under the same conditions, the survival of Hormosira and Cystophora zygotes ranged between 50{\%} and 60{\%} and between 80{\%} and 90{\%} when given 12 h to attach. Durvillaea, in contrast, had between 90{\%} and 100{\%} survival at both 6- and 12-h setting times. In other experiments, H. banksii and D. antarctica zygotes were given either 1, 6, or 12 h to attach and then placed for 12 h into sites within three levels of wave exposure (sheltered, intermediate and exposed). Survival of Hormosira zygotes given 1 and 6 h to attach was poor, ranging from 1{\%} to 8{\%}. If given 12 h to set, however, 5-8{\%} of Hormosira zygotes survived, even at the exposed sites. Under similar conditions, Durvillaea survival was significantly higher, ranging from 70{\%} to 100{\%} at all post-settlement times, in sites of all exposures. Wave action clearly affects the ability of sheltered shore species to settle in exposed sites. However, our study highlights the importance of factors other than wave action in determining the distribution and abundance of post-settlement stages of D. antarctica across exposures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Namibia forms the northern part of the Benguela marine province in south-western Africa. A splitting of the province into two sub-provinces has been proposed on zoogeographical evidence. This split is the result of decreasing species diversity in the northern regions, and is therefore not a taxonomic division. A number of factors have been found to affect seaweed biogeography on the Namibian coast, e.g. temperature factors, habitat availability and heterogeneity, sand inundation, etc. These factors also have an effect the local occur- rence and abundance of certain species. Biomass sampling quadrats were taken at regular intervals up the shore and the species composition determined. Southern Namibia is separated from northern and central Namibia, due to the dominance of different species. Southern and northern Namibia had a greater horizontal spread on the primary axis of the DCA analysis, reflecting their greater habitat availability and heterogeneity. The shores of central Namibia, in contrast, exhibit minimal variation between shores. The difference between southern and central Namibia is an ecological shift brought about by an increase in temperature in the northern regions and a relatively high degree of sand inundation. The latter has result- ed in the dominance of sand-tolerant species. As a result, the sub-province is an ecological entity rather than a floristic one.},

abstract = {To investigate the influence of marine macrophyte wrack subsidies on community structure, relationships between community attributes, including species richness, abundance, and biomass of macrofauna and abundance of shorebirds, and a variety of factors, including the standing crop of wrack and beach morphodynamics, were examined on 15 exposed sandy beaches on the southern California coast. The beaches sampled were primarily modally intermediate morphodynamic types, and three were groomed regularly. Species richness, abundance, and biomass of the macrofauna were high compared to values reported for similar beach types in other regions and were not predicted by morphodynamics or other physical factors. Overall species richness and abundance, and the species richness, abundance, and biomass of wrack-associated fauna and selected taxa were significantly correlated with the standing crop of macrophyte wrack. Wrack-associated macrofauna, such as amphipods, isopods, and insects, made up an average of {\textgreater}37{\%} of the species on ungroomed beaches and comprised 25{\%} or more of the total abundance on half of those beaches. The abundance of two shorebird species, plovers that forage using visual cues, was positively correlated with the standing crop of wrack and with the abundance of wrack-associated invertebrates. Significant differences in community structure, including depressed species richness, abundance, and biomass of macrofauna, especially for wrack-associated taxa, were associated with beach grooming and provided strong evidence for the bottom-up effects of wrack subsidies. Grooming also reduced the prey available to vertebrate predators, such as shorebirds. Substantial ecological effects of the large-scale disturbance and removal of organic material, food resources, and habitat are associated with beach grooming. These results suggest that macrophyte wrack subsidies strongly influence macrofaunal community structure, higher trophic levels, and ecological processes on exposed sandy beaches. The supply of macrophyte wrack should be considered as a factor in ecological studies of exposed sandy beaches, particularly where macrophyte production is high.},

In a series of experiments on recruitment of invertebrates, I partitioned the habitat- modifying effects of kelp into their positive and negative effects. Experiments revealed that a reduction of light intensity and removal of sediment by canopies acted to facilitate recruitment, but physical abrasion by the canopy acted as a negative force to overpower these positive effects. Understorey assemblages, therefore, represent biased subsets of taxa from a local pool capable of colonization. On balance, negative effects acted to exclude invertebrates from the understorey community. The asymmetric strength of negative effects not only explains the enigma of exclusion but also indicates that, when it exists, understorey coexistence with canopy plants must reflect a more even match between positive and negative effects.},

abstract = {Current and wave properties were studied in the semi-protected waters of the San Juan Archipelago, Washington, at 6 shallow subtidal sites chosen to include a wide range of variability in exposure to both tidal currents and waves. Within each site, 4 to 6 plots measuring roughly 50 to 100 m(2) each were established on nearly horizontal rock platforms at mean depths ranging from 6.1 to 11.0 m, with most plots at mean depths of 7.0 to 9.2 m. Plots were established nominally to minimize within-site variability in hydrodynamics, and were locations of several species of kelp (reported in a companion paper). For more than a year replicate measurements of flow and pressure (mean depth and wave signals) were collected at all sites in 2 Hz bursts 25 cm above the substratum, a height relative to understory kelps, providing a unique, detailed spatial and temporal characterization of a shallow subtidal hydrodynamic regime pertinent to these plants. Despite the intended similarity of plots within sites, local-flow microhabitat remained substantial at scales relative to understory plants, and largely ameliorated differences in tidal signals among most sites. Greater than 50{\%} of the spatial variability in maximum tidal current speed, and 31 to 44{\%} of the variance in the duration of periods of calm flow (speeds consistently {\textless}20 cm s(-1)), occurred within sites at scales of meters, and not at the larger (km) scales that separated sites. In contrast, wave effects at 7 to 11 m depth were predictable spatially. Significant wave impacts were recorded only at 2 sites characterized by a large, open fetch. Wave-dominated flows were recorded by replicate sensors multiple times within both of these sites, and the strongest instantaneous wave speeds approached 150 to 200 cm s(-1). Maximum wave-generated speeds recorded just above the substratum at these 2 sites were similar to2 to 3x maximum tidal currents. These results help to explain patterns noted in concurrent studies of the population dynamics and morphology of several species of kelp.},

abstract = {Population dynamics and the effects of intraspecific competition on limpet growth and maintenance of bare patches were investigated for the intertidal limpet Cellana ornata (Dillwyn) at a boulder-dominated site and on a rocky platform near Kaikoura (South Island), New Zealand. Distribution and abundance patterns of C. ornata were described in relation to other biota and tidal height. C. ornata occurred almost exclusively in patches devoid of macroalgae, particularly in the mid-tidal zone. Both adult and juvenile limpets were most abundant on the tops of boulders, where their numbers were positively correlated with barnacle cover, which averaged 77{\%}. The size structure and growth patterns of C. ornata were different between populations. Mark-recapture studies showed that the slopes of annual growth increments regressed on initial sizes were similar at both sites but that the annual increments on the platform were about 6 mm greater than on boulders. Growth virtually ceased at 27 mm for limpets at the barnacle-dominated boulder site and at 40 mm at the platform site. Recruiting cohorts had 20{\%} survival on boulders and 37{\%} on the platform during their first year. The largest size classes at both sites had around 57{\%} annual survival. To test the effects of varying limpet densities on the growth and mortality of limpets and the maintenance of bare patches, densities of C. ornata were experimentally increased at both sites. Beyond a density of 4 per 0.25 m2, sizes and survival of limpets were reduced at both sites, but the effect was more pronounced at the boulder site. Limpets at the boulder site were more effective at maintaining bare space than those on the reef platform. Enclosing limpets in plots with and without barnacles showed that C. ornata and a co-occurring species (Cellana denticulata (Martyn)) grazed more effectively and had greater growth in cleared plots. Overall, there was considerable variation in the demographics of C. ornata between populations driven by site-specific characteristics. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent discussions on scaling issues in ecology have emphasized that processes acting at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales influence ecosystems and thus there is no appropriate single scale at which ecological processes should be studied. This may be particularly true for environmental disturbances (e.g. El Ni{\~{n}}o) that occur over large geographic areas and encompass a wide range of scales relevant to ecosystem function. However, it may be possible to identify the scale(s) at which ecosystems are most strongly impacted by disturbances, and thus provide a measure by which their impacts can be most clearly described, by assessing scale-dependent changes in the patterns of variability in species abundance and distribution. This, in turn, may yield significant insight into the relative importance of the various forcing factors responsible for generating these impacts. The 1997-98 El Ni{\~{n}}o was one of the strongest El Ni{\~{n}}os ever recorded. I examined how this event impacted giant kelp populations in the northeast Pacific Ocean at 90 sites ranging from central Baja California, Mexico to central California, USA. These sites spanned the geographic range of giant kelp in the Northeast Pacific and were surveyed just before, immediately following, several months after, more than 1 year after, and nearly 2 years after the El Ni{\~{n}}o. I used a hierarchical sample design to compare these impacts at five spatial scales spanning six orders of magnitude, from a few meters to more than 1,000 km. Variance Components Analyses revealed that the El Ni{\~{n}}o shifted control over giant kelp abundance from factors acting at the scale of a few meters (local control) to factors operating over hundreds to thousands of kilometers (regional control). Moreover, El Ni{\~{n}}o resulted in the near-complete loss of all giant kelp throughout one-half of the species' range in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Giant kelp recovery following El Ni{\~{n}}o was far more complex and variable at multiple spatial scales, presumably driven by numerous factors acting at those scales. Recovery returned local control of giant kelp populations within 6 months in southern California, and within 2 years in Baja California.},

abstract = {One of the key issues concerning the application of microsatellite DNA data in evolutionary studies is how the number of loci applied may influence the stability of genetic distances and corresponding phylograms. While computer simulations have suggested that over 30 microsatellites are required for accurate evolutionary inference, we show that a median of only six loci have been generally applied in studies of wild populations. Factors contributing to this contrast include: i) uncertainty regarding the potential benefits that can be gained from a realistic increase in the number of loci used; and ii) the lack of empirical studies assessing the influence of the number of microsatellites on the reliability of genetic distance estimation and phylogeny construction. In order to address these issues, we applied resampling techniques to microsatellite data in widely distributed populations of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus, Salmonidae). In agreement with expectations based on simulated data, we demonstrate empirically that the stability of commonly used genetic distances (DCE, DA and (deltamu)2) and the corresponding neighbor-joining phylograms is positively associated with the number of microsatellites utilized. For instance, increasing the number of loci from six to 17 resulted in a striking 75{\%} increase in the proportion of DCE phylogram nodes supported by a bootstrap estimate of over 70{\%}. Our results demonstrate that even moderately increasing the number of loci can be very beneficial--a finding extremely relevant for studies of natural populations for which optimally high microsatellite numbers are out of reach. Furthermore, the number of loci most commonly used to date may lead to erroneous inference of the evolutionary relationships between populations.},

abstract = {The recruitment of algae is a critical process during algal colonization and invasions, including coral- to-algal phase shifts. Although algae are widely as- sumed to colonize and kill corals, there is very little known about the recruitment dynamics of coral reef algae. This study tested the ability of two dominant macroalgae (Fucales including Sargassum spp. and Lobophora variegata) to settle and grow on healthy coral tissue. The study also explored the effects of interactions with prior occupants, and of abiotic sub- strate properties (texture, and ceramic and carbonate material). The results indicate that healthy corals were able to prevent attachment or survival of recruits of these macroalgae. This is a significant point, since it suggests that the replacement of corals by algae may often require prior stress or death in the coral tissue. Pre-conditioning of plates at different sites had some effects, but these were relatively minor, whereas there was considerable variation within sites. Some of this variation appeared to be related to the amount of turf algae or crustose coralline algae on the plates. Recruitment was generally, but not always, higher on plates with rougher texture. Overall, this preliminary exploration indicates considerable potential for vari- ability in outcomes of algal colonization, with implica- tions for the dynamics of algal invasions. In particular, the results do not support suggestions that planktonic algal propagules can directly settle on and colonize healthy coral tissue.},

abstract = {Quantifying the spatial and temporal scales over which ecological processes are coupled to environmental variability is a major challenge for ecologists. Here, I assimilate patterns of oceanographic variability with ecological field studies in an attempt to quantify spatial and temporal scales of coupling. Using coastal time series of chlorophyll-a concentration from remote sensing, the first chapter examines the alongshore extent of coastal regions subject to similar temporal patterns of oceanographic variability in Western North America (WNA) and North-Central Chile (Chile). I found striking interhemispherical differences in the length of coastal sections under similar oceanographic regimes, with the Chile region showing longshore coherency over much smaller spatial scales ({\~{}}60 km) than on the coast of WNA ({\~{}}140 km). Through a spatial analysis of coastal orientation I suggest that the characteristic length scales may be traced to the geomorphologic character of the ocean margins. The second chapter examines spatial patterns of primary production through long-term means of coastal chlorophyll-a concentration and kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) cover and explores their relationship with coastal geomorphology and sea surface temperature (SST). Spatial analyses showed a striking match in length scales around 180-250 km. Strong anticorrelations at small spatial lags and positive correlations at longer distances suggest little overlap between patches of kelp and coastal chlorophyll-a. In agreement with findings from the previous chapter, I found that coastal patches could be traced back to spatial patterns of coastal geomorphology. Through SST time series and long-term datasets of larval recruitment in Santa Cruz Island, California, the third chapter examines temporal patterns of oceanographic variability as determinants of ecological patterns. SST time series from sites experiencing low larval recruitment rates were dominated by strong temporal variability. These sites also experienced the coldest SST detected during the study suggesting the presence of recently upwelled waters containing low number of larvae. Larval supply, along with patterns of community organization presented an accompanying manuscript, indicated that very strong upwelling may generate recruitment limitation of populations of intertidal invertebrates. xii},

abstract = {The photosynthesis–irradiance response of Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, a common kelp in the temperate southern hemisphere, was investigated in situ throughout the year and across a depth profile at West Island, South Australia. Temperature and irradi- ance environment altered throughout the year, varying at 3 m between 14–20?C and 279–705 lmol pho- tons m?2 s?1. Photosynthetic capacity (Pm) varied throughout the year between 177–278 lmol O2 g?1 dry wt h?1 at 3 m and 133–348 lmol O2 g?1 dry wt h?1 at 10 m. The irradiance required for sub-saturation of photosynthesis (Ek) varied between 97–152 and 81– 142 lmol photons m?2 s?1 for 3 m and 10 m respec- tively, and the respiration rate varied between 15–36 and 13–20 lmol O2 g?1 dry wt h?1 for 3 m and 10 m. A clear seasonal change in photokinetic parameters was detected and provided strong evidence for a seasonal acclimation response. During winter an increase in the efficiency of light utilisation at low irradiance (a) was accompanied by a decrease in both Ek and that required for photosynthetic compensation. Pm also increased during the winter and autumn months and respiratory requirements decreased. These changes enable E. radiata to display an optimal photosynthetic performance throughout the year despite significant changes in the surrounding environment.},

abstract = {The causes of spatial variation in the recruitment of benthic marine algae are frequently misunderstood because of difficulties in distinguishing among the many factors that influence the supply and establishment of microscopic propagules. We used the recently constructed San Clemente Artificial Reef (SCAR) experiment to examine the roles of dispersal distance, size of spore source, and habitat availability as sources of variation in the recruitment of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Ag., a species whose recruitment has often been considered to be dispersal limited. Sparse colonization on SCAR by adult Macrocystis occurred within 6 months after reef construction via drifters (i.e. individuals from neighboring kelp beds that became dislodged and set adrift). The abundance of drifters on SCAR declined exponentially with distance from the nearest source population (San Mateo), suggesting that San Mateo was the likely source of drifters. Dense recruitment of small Macrocystis sporophytes was observed within 8 months of reef construction. The density of recruits on SCAR showed an initial increase with distance from San Mateo before declining exponentially. Nonetheless, substantial recruitment was observed at the most distant locations on SCAR located 3.5 km from San Mateo. In contrast to drifters, the density of recruits was positively correlated to the bottom cover of artificial reef substrate. Importantly, no correlation was found between the local density or fecundity of drifters and the local density of kelp recruits suggesting that recruitment on SCAR resulted from widespread spore dispersal rather than from the local dispersal of spores from drifters.},

abstract = {A long-standing issue in marine biology is identifying spatial scales at which populations of sessile adults are connected by planktonic offspring. We examined the genetic continuity of the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula, an abundant member of rocky intertidal communities of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and compared these genetic patterns to the nearshore oceanography described by trajectories of surface drifters. Consistent with its broad dispersal potential, barnacle populations are genetically similar at both mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) and nuclear (elongation factor 1-alpha) loci across broad swaths of the species' range. In central California, however, there is a striking genetic cline across 475 km of coastline between northern and southern populations. These patterns indicate that gene flow within central California is far more restricted spatially than among other populations. Possible reasons for the steep cline include the slow secondary introgression of historically separated populations, a balance between diversifying selection and dispersal, or some mix of both. Geographic trajectories of oceanic drifters closely parallel geographical patterns of gene flow. Drifters placed to the north (Oregon; approximately 44 degrees N) and south (Santa Barbara, California; approximately 34 degrees N) of the cline disperse hundreds of kilometers within 40 days, yet over the long-term their trajectories never overlapped. The lack of communication between waters originating in Oregon and southern California probably helps to maintain strong genetic differentiation between these regions. More broadly, the geographical variation in gene flow implies that focusing on species-level averages of gene flow can mask biologically important variance within species which reflects local environmental conditions and historical events.},

Our results indicate that individual multicellular female gametophytes can live rise to more than one oogonium and that per capita oogonia production significantly increases with the enhancement of culture condition: (i.e., decreased temperature and increased nutrient concentration). Furthermore. the production of multiple oogonia per female often led to the production of multiple sporophytes per female.

abstract = {A regime shift is considered to be a sudden shift in structure and functioning of a marine ecosystem, affecting several living components and resulting in an alternate state. According to this definition, regime shifts differ from species replacement or alternation of species at similar trophic levels, whereby the ecosystem is not necessarily significantly altered in terms of its structure and function; only its species composition changes. This paper provides an overview of regime shifts, species replacements and alternations that have been observed in the northern and southern Benguela ecosystems over the past few decades. Bottom-up control, initiating and sustaining regime shifts or species replacements via environmental forcing, is documented for both the southern and the northern Benguela ecosystems. Fishing (a case of top-down control) appears to have played an important role in regime shift processes in the Namibian ecosystem. Very low biomass levels of exploited fish stocks associated with less efficient energy transfer in the northern Benguela are indicative of a regime shift. Very high biomass levels have been reached in the southern Benguela in the 2000s. However the alternation between sardine and anchovy that has been observed in the southern Benguela over the last two decades appears not to have had major effects on the overall functioning of the ecosystem. The consequences of regime shifts for exploitation are highlighted, suggesting that fisheries managers should move towards a more effective ecosystem approach to fisheries. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {One of the most commonly predicted effects of global ocean warming on marine communities is a poleward shift in the distributional boundaries of species with an associated replacement of cold-water species by warm-water species. However, these types of predictions are imprecise and based largely on broad correlations in uncontrolled studies that examine changes in the distribution or abundances of species in relation to seawater temperature. Our study used an 18-year sampling program in intertidal and subtidal habitats and before-after, control-impact analyses. We show that a 3.5degreesC rise in seawater temperature, induced by the thermal outfall of a power-generating station, over 10 years along 2 km of rocky coastline in California resulted in significant community-wide changes in 150 species of algae and invertebrates relative to adjacent control areas experiencing natural temperatures. Contrary to predictions based on current biogeographic models, there was no trend toward warmer-water species with southern geographic affinities replacing colder-water species with northern affinities. Instead, the communities were greatly altered in apparently cascading responses to changes in abundance of several key taxa, particularly habitat-forming subtidal kelps and intertidal foliose red algae. Many temperature-sensitive algae decreased greatly in abundance, whereas many invertebrate grazers increased. The responses of these benthic communities to ocean warming were-mostly unpredicted and strongly, coupled to direct effects of temperature on key taxa and indirect effects operating through ecological interactions.},

abstract = {In marine environments, many species have apparently colonized high latitude regions fol- lowing the last glacial maximum (LGM) yet lack a life-history stage, such as a free-living larva, that is clearly capable of long-distance dispersal. Two hypotheses can explain the modern high latitude distributions of these marine taxa: (1) survival in northern refugia during the LGM or (2) rapid post-glacial dispersal by nonlarval stages. To distinguish these two scenarios, I characterized the genetic structure of two closely related northeastern Pacific gastropods that lack planktonic larvae but which have distributions extending more than 1000 km north of the southern limit of glaciers at the LGM. Despite having identical larval dispersal potential, these closely related species exhibit fundamentally different pat- terns of genetic structure. In Nucella ostrina , haplotype diversity among northern popu- lations (British Columbia and Alaska) is low, no pattern of isolation by distance exists and a coalescent-based model of population growth indicates that during the LGM population size was reduced to less than 35{\%} of its current size. In the congeneric and often sympatric N. lamellosa , northern populations harbour a diversity of ancient private haplotypes, sig- nificant evidence of isolation by distance exists and regional subdivision was found between northern (Alaska) and southern (southern British Columbia, Washington and Oregon) popu- lations. Estimates of coalescent parameters indicate only a modest reduction in population size during the LGM and that northern and southern populations of N. lamellosa split ∼ 50 Kyr before the LGM. The patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that N. ostrina recently reinvaded the northeastern Pacific but N. lamellosa survived the LGM in a north- ern refuge. A comparison of similar studies in this region indicates that depleted levels of genetic variation at high latitudes — evidence suggestive of recent colonization from a southern refuge — is more common among intertidal species that live relatively high on the shore, where exposure times to cold stress in air are longer than for species living lower on the shore. These data suggest that for some faunas, ecological differences between taxa may be more important than larval dispersal potential in determining species' long-term biogeographical responses to climate change.},

abstract = {At the end of the summer, drifting filamentous red algae cover shallow bottoms and accumulate in huge cast walls on the open shores of the non-tidal central Baltic Sea. The hypotheses that beach cleaning increases water clarity, decreases the organic content of the sand, and increases the species diversity in the shallow zone closest to the shore, were tested through field investigations and experiments. Cleaned shorelines were compared with un-cleaned shorelines at two sites with different intensity of beach cleaning in a rural area of SE Sweden. The results show that water clarity was significantly increased off the intensively cleaned beach but not off the moderately cleaned one. Similarly, the total leakage of nitrogenous compounds decreased off the intensively cleaned beach, but not off the moderately cleaned. The organic content of the sand was lower on both cleaned beaches compared with nearby uncleaned beaches. The total animal biomass was significantly lower on the intensively cleaned beach compared with the un-cleaned beach, but the moderately cleaned beach gave no such effect. The difference in biodiversity and community structure between cleaned and un-cleaned beaches was insignificant. The most obvious difference in species composition was a much higher number of planktivore opossum shrimps of the genus Mysis and Praunus on the un-cleaned beaches. The bacterial production and the amount of ciliates larger than 20 mm were also higher on un-cleaned beaches, indicating that the microbial food web off the un-cleaned beaches is stimulated by the discharge of decomposing algal material. The conclusion of the study is that mechanical cleaning reduces the organic content of the beach sand and may change the water quality and microbial production, but the effect on the macrofaunal biodiversity is insignificant. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationships between LOI at 550 degreesC (LOI550) and organic carbon (OC) content and between LOI at 950 degreesC (LOI950) and inorganic carbon (IC) content are currently accepted as a standard. However, the comparison of 150 analyses of samples of diverse lithologies, collected from a single core, reveals that these relationships are affected by sediment composition (presence of clays, salts, and the variable content of organic carbon). This results in an incremental error on the estimation of carbon content from LOI values that invalidates the use of LOI values as a quantitative method for estimating carbon content. Conversely, the general trends of LOI550 and LOI950 show a good correlation with carbon content (both organic and inorganic) allowing use of LOI as a qualitative test for carbon content. Similarly, in our case, LOI at 105degreesC (LOI105) is a good qualitative proxy for the trends in gypsum content.},

abstract = {Two ecological paradigms, the trophic cascade and the host-density threshold in disease, interact in the kelp-forest ecosystem to structure the community. To investigate what happens when a trophic cascade pushes a host population over a host-threshold density, I analyzed a 10-year data set of kelp forest communities at 16 sites in the region of the Channel Islands National Park, CA, USA. Historically, lobsters, and perhaps other predators, kept urchin populations at low levels and kelp forests developed a community-level trphic cascade. In geographic areas where the main predators on urchins were fished, urchin populations increased to the extent that they overgrazed algage and starvation eventually limited urchin-population growth. Despite the limitation of urchin population size by food availability, urchin densities, at times, well exceeded the host-density threshold for epidemics. An urchin-specific bacterial disease entered the region after 1992 and acted as a density dependent mortality source. Dense populations were more likely to experience epidemics and suffer higher mortality. Disease did not reduce the urchin population at a site to the density that prediators previously did. Therefore, disease did not fully replace predators in the trophic cascade. These results indicate how fishing top predators can indirectly favor disease transmission in prey populations.},

This impact propagates up the food web (bottom-up control) through copepod herbivores to zooplankton carnivores because of tight trophic coupling. Future warming is therefore likely to alter the spatial distribution of primary and secondary pelagic production, affecting ecosystem services and placing additional stress on already-depleted fish and mammal populations.},

Dislodgment bared clean substratum where re-invasion by propagules or encroachment would be necessary to fill up the gaps. Maximum break forces (150-250 N) were found for large late stage kelps and kelp aggregates from wave exposed sandstone and granite reefs, and minimum values (25-100 N) for small juveniles and solitary kelps from protected limestone reefs. By applying size and break force data to the drag equation, water velocities required to break or dislodge E radiata were calculated to 2-5 ms(-1) for large kelps. These velocities are frequently encountered in wave-exposed shallow subtidal habitats, suggesting that thallus size is limited by the hydrodynamic environment.},

abstract = {Rafting has been inferred as an important dispersal mechanism in the marine environ- ment by many authors. The success of rafting depends critically on the availability of suitable floating substrata. Herein currently available information on floating items that have been reported to carry rafting organisms is summarised. Floating items of biotic origin comprise macroalgae, seeds, wood, other vascular plants, and animal remains. Volcanic pumice (natural) and a diverse array of litter and tar lumps (anthropogenic) are the main floating items of abiotic origin. Macroal- gae, wood, and plastic macrolitter cover a wide range of sizes while pumice, microlitter, and tar lumps typically are {\textless}10 cm in diameter. The longevity of floating items at the sea surface depends on their origin and likelihood to be destroyed by secondary consumers (in increasing order): nonlignified vascular plants/animal carcasses {\textless} macroalgae {\textless} driftwood {\textless} tar lumps/skeletal remains {\textless} plastic litter {\textless} volcanic pumice. In general, abiotic substrata have a higher longevity than biotic substrata, but most abiotic items are of no or only limited food value for potential rafters. Macroalgae are most abundant at mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, driftwood is of major importance in northern and tropical waters, and floating seeds appear to be most common in tropical regions. Volcanic pumice can be found at all latitudes but has primarily been reported from the Pacific Ocean. Plastic litter and tar lumps are most abundant near the centres of human population and activities. In some regions of abundant supply or zones of hydrography-driven accumulation, floating items can be extremely abundant, exceeding 1000 items km –2 . Temporal supply of floating items is variable, being seasonal for most biotic substrata and highly sporadic for some items such as volcanic pumice. Most reported velocities of floating items are in the range of 0.5–1.0 km h –1 , but direct measurements have shown that they occasionally are transported at much faster velocities. Published trajectories of floating items also coincide with the main oceanic currents, even though strong winds may sometimes push them out of the principal current systems. Many studies hint toward floating items to link source regions with coastal sinks, in some cases across long distances and even entire ocean basins. Fossil evidence suggests that rafting has also occurred in palaeo- oceans. During recent centuries and decades the composition and abundance of floating items in the world's oceans have been strongly affected by human activities, in particular logging, river and coastline regulation, and most importantly oil exploitation and plastic production. The currently abundant supply and the characteristics of floating items suggest that rafting continues to be an important dispersal mechanism in present-day oceans.},

abstract = {The southern sea palm kelp Eisenia arborea produces wide, bullate (bumpy) blades in low-flow areas, whereas in adjacent high-flow areas blades are flat and narrow. Here we determine if morphological differences in these 2 closely associated populations are correlated with physical factors in the environment, and whether this response is a genetically fixed or plastic trait. Both phe- notypes were subjected to morphometric analysis, field and laboratory transplant experiments, and genetic analysis (M13 DNA fingerprinting). Physical variables (water motion, temperature, and light) were monitored simultaneously in the field. Results indicate that the 2 populations, separated by {\textless}10m, are genetically distinct and transplants in the field and lab remained similar to individuals from the original collection location, regardless of the imposed flow environment. Water motion var- ied significantly between the 2 populations and was the single physical variable that correlated with morphology. Based on bump heights and water velocities in the field, bullate blades could increase turbulent transport of nutrients 4-fold that of flat blades. The thicker blades and large holdfasts of the flat morph may impart higher survivorship under high-flow conditions. This suggests water motion selects for 2 distinct morphotypes of E. arborea that represent adaptations to enhance fitness under different nutrient availability and drag force regimes. Thus, blade morphology is not a plastic response to the local environment but a genetically fixed trait and may be indicative of nascent spe- ciation in the face of strong selection by water motion over spatial scales smaller than observed pre- viously in kelps},

abstract = {We use archaeological, historical, ecological, and fisheries data to identify three distinct and sequen- tial phases in the trophic structure of kelp forests in the western North Atlantic's Gulf of Maine. Phase 1 is characterized by vertebrate apex predators such as Atlantic cod, haddock, and wolffish and persisted for more than 4,000 years. Phase 2 is characterized by herbivorous sea urchins and lasted from the 1970s to the 1990s. Phase 3 is dominated by invertebrate predators such as large crabs and has developed since 1995. Each phase change re- sulted directly or indirectly from fisheries-induced "trophic-level dysfunction," in which populations of functionally important species at higher trophic levels fell below the densities necessary to limit prey populations at lower trophic levels. By using frac- tional trophic-level analysis, we found that phase changes occurred rapidly (over a few years to a few decades) as well as relatively recently (over the past half-century). Interphase durations have declined as fishing effects have accelerated in recent years. The naturally low species diversity of the kelp forest ecosystem we studied may facilitate rapid changes because the redundancy within each trophic level is low. If the biodiversity within controlling trophic levels is a buffer against trophic-level dysfunction, then our observations from Maine may be predic- tive of the fate of other, more diverse systems. If fishing successively targets most, or all, strong in- teractors at higher trophic levels, then as those pop- ulation densities decline, the potential for trophic- level dysfunction and associated instabilities will increase.},

abstract = {The distributions and abundances of species and populations change almost continu- ously. Understanding the processes responsible is perhaps ecologyʼs most fundamental challenge. Kelp-forest ecosystems in southwest Alaska have undergone several phase shifts between alga- and herbivore-dominated states in recent decades. Overhunting and recovery of sea otters caused the earlier shifts. Studies focusing on these changes demonstrate the importance of top-down forcing processes, a variety of indirect food- web interactions associated with the otter-urchin-kelp trophic cascade, and the role of food-chain length in the coevolution of defense and resistance in plants and their her- bivores. This system unexpectedly shifted back to an herbivore-dominated state during the 1990s, because of a sea-otter population collapse that apparently was driven by increased predation by killer whales. Reasons for this change remain uncertain but seem to be linked to the whole-sale collapse of marine mammals in the North Pacific Ocean and southern Bering Sea. We hypothesize that killer whales sequentially “fished down” pinniped and sea-otter populations after their earlier prey, the great whales, were decimated by commercial whaling. The dynamics of kelp forests in southwest Alaska thus appears to have been influenced by an ecological chain reaction that encompassed numerous species and large scales of space and time.},

The majority (71{\%}) of thalli dislodged at the rock implying that the canopy removal process in southwestern Australia is a substratum-controlled process. Dislodgment bared clean substratum where re-invasion by propagules or encroachment would be necessary to fill up the gaps. Maximum break forces (150-250 N) were found for large late stage kelps and kelp aggregates from wave exposed sandstone and granite reefs, and minimum values (25-100 N) for small juveniles and solitary kelps from protected limestone reefs. By applying size and break force data to the drag equation, water velocities required to break or dislodge E radiata were calculated to 2-5 ms(-1) for large kelps. These velocities are frequently encountered in wave-exposed shallow subtidal habitats, suggesting that thallus size is limited by the hydrodynamic environment.},

abstract = {The worldwide decline of coral reefs calls for an urgent reassessment of current management practices. Confronting large-scale crises requires a major scaling-up of management efforts based on an improved understanding of the ecological processes that underlie reef resilience. Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of human activity in shaping ecosystems, provides a basis for coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological surprises. Here we review the ecological roles of critical functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that are fundamental to understanding resilience and avoiding phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable, degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic differences in the species richness and composition of functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of Caribbean reef ecosystems. These findings have profound implications for restoration of degraded reefs, management of fisheries, and the focus on marine protected areas and biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation.},

abstract = {$\backslash$n* 1. The coastal waters surrounding Britain and Ireland became warmer during the 20th century and, according to the UK Climate Impact Programme 2002 scenarios of change and other sources, average annual seawater temperatures may rise a further 2°C or more by the 2050s. This warming is part of a global rise in sea- and air-surface temperatures that will cause changes in the distribution and abundance of species.$\backslash$n* 2. Initially, there will not be a wholesale movement northwards of southern species or retreat northwards of northern species, because many additional factors will influence the responses of the different organisms. Such factors include the hydrodynamic characteristics of water masses, the presence of hydrographical and geographical barriers to spread and the life history characteristics (reproductive mode, dispersal capability and longevity) of species. Survey data over the past century show how organisms react to changes of the order of 0. 5°C, and in the last two decades, when sea temperatures have risen by as much as 1°C, there have been significant local changes in the distribution of intertidal organisms. These past changes provide a clue to more extensive changes expected in the future if global warming develops as predicted.$\backslash$n* 3. Where species affected by climate change are dominant or key structural or functional species in biotopes, there may be a change in the extent and distribution of those biotopes. Some, dominated by predominantly northern species such as the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus, may decline and reduce their value as rich habitats for marine life. Others, characterized by southern species, for example the sea fan Eunicella verrucosa and the alcyonacean Alcyonium glomeratum, may increase in extent.$\backslash$n* 4. Using information on the life history characteristics of species, their present distribution and other factors, a key supported by a decision tree has been constructed to identify ‘types' of organism according to their likely response to temperature rise. Conspicuous and easily identified rocky substratum species are good candidates to track change. Using the key, many species are shown as likely to increase their range northwards significantly. In contrast, fewer will decline in abundance and extent in the north. If, as anticipated, global warming continues, then species with distributions already accurately mapped, or being mapped at present, will provide baseline data to test forecasts.

abstract = {New, large-scale collections have been made of marine benthic macroalgae (seaweeds) on the east coast of South Africa, and the distributions of shallow-water species were analyzed in detail by multivariate, cluster- ing and b-diversity methods. The two northernmost sites are distinct, with a predominance of tropical species, and it is concluded that the changeover from a tropical In- dian Ocean flora to a temperate South African flora occurs most rapidly in the vicinity of St. Lucia, 135 km south of the Mozambique border. It is imperative that all future biogeographical studies on the South African inshore marine biota include detailed collections north of St. Lucia. The remaining 440 km of the South African east coast (southern and central Kwazulu-Natal Prov- ince) is populated by a mixture of tropical and temperate elements, with only 2{\%} endemism in this data set. This, thus, represents a true overlap region, with relatively equal numbers of species with affinities in the temperate Agulhas and tropical Indo–West Pacific floras, rather than a distinctive sub-tropical marine province, as the South African east coast is considered to be by most previous authors. The distinction between this overlap region and the south coast (Agulhas) region proper is not as clearly distinct. The change from a temperate to a Communicated by O. Kinne, Oldendorf/Luhe J. J.

abstract = {The physical-biological linkages controlling the dispersal of spores produced by macroalgae that reside in kelp forests are complicated and laced with feedbacks. Here we discuss the fundamental elements of these interactions. Biological considerations include spore swimming and sinking speeds, their periods of viability in the plankton, and the height of spore release above the seafloor, which together determine the durations over which spores can be swept by horizontal currents before they contact the seafloor. Morphologies and material properties of canopy forming kelps may also influence the drag exerted on passing waters by the kelps, the plants' ability to persist in the face of rapid flows, and thereby the degree to which impinging currents are redirected around, or slowed within, kelp forests. Macroalgal life histories, and the size of spore sources as controlled by the dimensions of kelp forests and the density and fecundity of individuals within them, influence effective dispersal distances as well. Physical considerations encompass the mean speed, direction, and timescales of variability of currents relative to spore suspension times, the interaction of surface gravity waves with currents in producing turbulence in the benthic boundary layer, wind-driven surface mixing, water stratification, and shoreline bathymetry and substratum roughness, all of which can affect the interplay of vertical and horizontal transport of macroalgal spores. Intricate within-forest processes may induce attenuation of current speeds and consequent reductions in seabed shear, along with simultaneous production of small-scale turbulence in kelp wakes. Slower mean currents and smaller eddy scales in turn may attenuate vertical mixing within forests, thus extending spore suspension times. Further complexities likely arise due to changes in the relative rates of horizontal and vertical dispersion, modifications to the overall profiles of vertical mixing, and the creation of fine-scale secondary flows around kelp individuals and substratum features. Under conditions of more rapid currents, submergence of the surface canopy and the establishment of skimming flows at the canopy-fluid interface may introduce additional coherent flow structures that alter rates of fluid exchange to and from the forest. Many of these coupled physical-biological processes are just beginning to be examined in a rigorous fashion in kelp forests, but their potential importance is clear. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Uptake rates of nitrate and phosphate were measured for four species and one variety of Porphyra from Long Island Sound (USA) at two temperatures and two nutrient medium concentrations at increasing intervals over a 24- or 48-h period. Maximum uptake rates found were: V 30 ??M0-1 h=73.8 ??mol NO 3 g -1 DW h -1 and V 3 ??M0-1 h=16.7 ??mol PO 4 g -1 DW h -1, in the two thinnest Porphyra. We found that the nitrate uptake rates were significantly greater at 30 ??M than 3 ??M NO 3 concentration, and that the uptake rates decreased with time of exposure. Temperature (5, 15, and 25??C) did not have as strong an effect on nitrate uptake rates as did nutrient concentration. Q 10 values and uptake rates at four different nitrate concentrations indicated that nutrient uptake at 5??C was initially an active process. After 24 h, the processes involved appeared passive as Q 10 values were between 1.0 and 1.3 and nitrate uptake curves were linear. Nitrate uptake rates correlated positively with the surface area/volume (SA/V) ratio. No coherent trends were found for uptake of phosphate, except that the uptake rates were significantly higher in 30 ??M NO 3 medium as opposed to 3 ??M NO 3. We did not find any significant difference in uptake rate and pattern between the summer species Porphyra purpurea (Roth.) C.

Analytical approaches are now possible that were unthinkable even five years ago due to limitations in computational power or the availability of DNA data, and this has vastly expanded the accuracy and types of information that may be gained from population genetic data. Here we provide a guide to recently developed methods for population genetic analysis, including identi- fication of population structure, quantification of gene flow, and inference of demographic history. We cover both allele-frequency and sequence-based approaches, with a special focus on methods relevant to conservation genetic applications. Although classical population genetic approaches such as FST (and its derivatives) have carried the field thus far, newer, more powerful, methods can infer much more from the data, rely on fewer assumptions, and are appropriate for conservation genetic management when precise estimates are needed.

abstract = {We examined the effects of shade from multiple kelp canopy layers (surface Macrocystis pyrifera canopy, understory Pterygophora californica canopy), both individually and in combination, on an understory algal assemblage in a central Californian kelp forest. The removal of both kelp canopies resulted in a dense recruitment of the understory brown alga Desmarestia ligulata that formed a third canopy layer, which significantly decreased bottom light and the abundance of under- story red algae. We subsequently created an additional canopy treatment by removing this third canopy layer. In general, the understory red algae fluctuated seasonally with winter swell intensity, changes in kelp canopy cover, and grazing; and although species richness increased significantly with increased bottom light, red algal bottom cover did not respond significantly to the canopy clear- ings until 2 yr after the canopies were initially cleared. Red algal cover within the Pterygophora canopy treatment was similar to that in the control treatment. In the absence of Pterygophora, the Macrocystis canopy treatment and ‘no canopy' treatment were found to have greater red algal cover and species richness. Individual understory species were rare, which resulted in small effects sizes and thus low statistical power. However, when grouped post hoc, according to how they responded to the canopy clearings (i.e. response groups), we were able to detect canopy treatment effects as much as 1 yr earlier. This method identified that some understory red algae adapted to areas of canopy removal (light-adapted), and others adapted to a variety of light regimes (shade-tolerant). We were able to classify the light-adapted algae into 2 subgroups: the high-light species and the inter- mediate-light species. Although this method of grouping was done post hoc, our results indicate that it may provide the clearest assessment of how understory algae respond to shading from kelp canopies. KEY},

Sporophytes of this kelp establish in dense stands only when the native algal canopy is reduced, and ex- perimental removal of native algae results in greatly increased cover of U. pinnatifida and sediment. Urchin barrens are integral to widespread establishment of U. pinnatifida because urchin grazing and sediment on barrens prevents native canopy-forming algae from colonizing, but is insufficient to prevent proliferation of U. pinnatifida. Estimates of population growth of the urchin and in situ rates of lobster predation on urchins reveal that fishing of lobsters can account for increases in urchin densities, ostensibly to levels enabling bar- rens formation. Lobsters are far more important predators of H. erythrogramma than are fishes. Thus, fishing of rock lobsters may ultimately account for the proliferation of U. pinnatifida in this area.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with physical factors and biological interactions affecting the distribution of two fucoid species, Fucus vesiculosus and F. serratus, in the Baltic Sea, N. Europe. Studies have been carried out in two quite different environments: an archipelago, and an open rocky coast. The archipelago has an extremely long coastline with a heterogeneous submerged landscape of different substrate types, slopes, water qualities, and degrees of wave exposure. The factors influencing F. vesiculosus distribution, morphology and epiphyte composition were studied in the Stockholm archipelago using field surveys and spatial modelling in Geographic information systems (GIS). A GIS-method to estimate wave exposure was developed and validated by comparing the result to an index based on vertical zonation of lichens. Wave exposure was considered an important factor for predicting the distribution of F. vesiculosus by its ability to clean hard surfaces from silt, and a predictive model was constructed based on the information of wave exposure and slope of the shore. It is suggested that the lower distribution boundary of attached F. vesiculosus is set by sediment in sheltered parts of the archipelago, and by light availability in highly wave exposed parts. The morphology of F. vesiculosus was studied over a wave exposure gradient, and several characters responded in accordance with earlier studies. However, when separating effects of wave exposure from effects of other confounding water property parameters, only thallus width was significantly different. Several water property parameters were shown to be correlated with wave exposure in the Stockholm archipelago, and the mechanism responsible for the effects on F. vesiculosus morphology is discussed. The composition of epiphytes on F. vesiculosus varied over a wave exposure gradient with a positive correlation to Elachista fucicola, and a negative to Chorda filum. At an open coast the physical environment is much less heterogeneous compared to an archipelago. The distributions of F. vesiculosus, F. serratus, turf-forming algae, and the seafloor substrate, were surveyed along the open coasts of Oeland and Gotland. Turf-forming algae dominated all hard substrates in the area, and Polysiphonia fucoides was most abundant. At the Gotland coast F. vesiculosus was less abundant than at the Oeland coast, and F. serratus occurred only in the southernmost part. Fucus serratus was increasingly more common towards south which was interpreted as an effect mainly of the Baltic salinity gradient, or the variation of salinity that has occurred in the past. The effects of turf-forming algae and sediment on F. serratus recruitment at 7 m depth off the Oeland east coast were studied in the field, and by laboratory experiments. Almost no recruits were found in the algal turf outside the F. serratus patches. More fine sediment was found in the turf than in the F. serratus patches, suggesting that the turf accumulates sediment by decreasing resuspension. Both filamentous algae and sediment decreased the attachment ability of F. serratus zygotes and survival of recruits, and sediment had the strongest effect. It is therefore suggested that F. serratus has difficulties recruiting outside its patches, and that these difficulties are enforced by the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea, which has favoured growth of filamentous algae and increased sedimentation. An overall conclusion is that Fucus distribution is affected by large-scale-factors, such as the eutrophication and salinity changes of the Baltic Sea, as well as by small-scale variation in wave exposure, substrate and slope, and by surface competition with neighbouring species.},

Multivariate analyses of the invertebrates on the algal fronds, those on the underlying substratum, and the 2 groups together demonstrated differences in invertebrate assemblages among all 5 habitats. A. esculenta sheltered the most distinct invertebrate community due to the domination of the substratum under this alga by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Differences among other canopy types were due to differences in invertebrate assemblages both on the algal fronds and on the substratum. A manipulative experiment involving the removal of the canopy of the 2 most abundant macroalgae, A. esculenta and A. cribrosum, was carried out to examine their effects on mussels. Recruitment of mussels onto ceramic tiles varied among treatments and was greatest in the A. esculenta zone with greater, but non-significant, recruitment under the canopy. The growth of mussels from early July to October was higher in the A. cribrosum zone than the A. esculenta zone. However, there was no effect of the algal canopy in either zone. Our study demonstrates that the local diversity and distribution of benthic invertebrates is intimately associated with macroalgae, and reinforces the need for detailed sampling and analyses for assessing distributional patterns.},

abstract = {Observations in the Gulf of Maine, USA, were used to characterize the freshwater transport, temporal variability and dynamics of the western Maine coastal current. These observations included moored measurements, multiple hydrographic surveys, and drifter releases during April-July of 1993 and 1994. There is a strong seasonal signal in salinity and along-shore velocity of the coastal current, caused by the freshwater inputs of the rivers entering the western Gulf. Surface salinity within the coastal current during the spring freshet is typically 2psu below ambient, and along-shore currents in the surface layer are directed southwestward at speeds of 0.10-0.20ms-1, occasionally reaching 0.50ms-1. The plume thickness is typically 10-20m in water depths of 50-100m, thus it is well isolated from the bottom over most of its areal extent. The along-coast freshwater transport within the plume varies considerably due to variations in wind stress, but on time scales of weeks to months it follows the variations of riverine input, with a time lag consistent with the advective velocity. Less than half of the transport of the coastal current is explained by the baroclinic gradient; the barotropic forcing associated with the larger-scale dynamics of the Gulf of Maine accounts for about 60{\%} of the transport. The volume of freshwater transport in the coastal current exceeds the local riverine input of fresh water by 30{\%}, suggesting a significant contribution of freshwater transport from the St. John River, 500km northeastward. The measurements within the western Maine coastal current, however, indicate a significant decrease in the baroclinic transport of fresh water along the coast, with an e-folding scale of approximately 200km. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovin- cialis was recorded in 79 {\%} of sampling areas that provided suitable rocky-shore habi- tat. The highest biomass (25.4 ± 18.7 kg/m²) was recorded in the mid-shore on Marcus Island, and total intertidal biomass in the Langebaan/Saldanha system was estimated at 281.6 tons. Including farmed and subtidal stocks, the area supports 4 362 tons M. gal- loprovincialis in summer and 959 tons in winter. No live individuals of the European shore crab Carcinus maenas were recorded, but a single dead carapace was found. The European periwinkle Littorina saxatilis had a limited distribution within Langebaan Lagoon and supported a total population of 2.4 million individuals. The alien anemone Sagartia ornata was recorded as locally abundant (up to 426 ± 81 individuals/m²) and was also restricted in distribution. Despite the extensive invasion of the Saldanha Bay–Langebaan Lagoon system by M. galloprovincialis, the threat to the West Coast National Park appears to be limited by low wave action and low nutrient supply to the rocky shores within the park. Although not present in detectable numbers, C. maenas poses a major threat to the park, should it become established there. The threats posed by L. saxatilis and S. ornata are presently unquantified but appear slight. Key},

abstract = {Rafting has been inferred as an important dispersal mechanism in the marine environ- ment by many authors. The success of rafting depends critically on the availability of suitable floating substrata. Herein currently available information on floating items that have been reported to carry rafting organisms is summarised. Floating items of biotic origin comprise macroalgae, seeds, wood, other vascular plants, and animal remains. Volcanic pumice (natural) and a diverse array of litter and tar lumps (anthropogenic) are the main floating items of abiotic origin. Macroal- gae, wood, and plastic macrolitter cover a wide range of sizes while pumice, microlitter, and tar lumps typically are {\textless}10 cm in diameter. The longevity of floating items at the sea surface depends on their origin and likelihood to be destroyed by secondary consumers (in increasing order): nonlignified vascular plants/animal carcasses {\textless} macroalgae {\textless} driftwood {\textless} tar lumps/skeletal remains {\textless} plastic litter {\textless} volcanic pumice. In general, abiotic substrata have a higher longevity than biotic substrata, but most abiotic items are of no or only limited food value for potential rafters. Macroalgae are most abundant at mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, driftwood is of major importance in northern and tropical waters, and floating seeds appear to be most common in tropical regions. Volcanic pumice can be found at all latitudes but has primarily been reported from the Pacific Ocean. Plastic litter and tar lumps are most abundant near the centres of human population and activities. In some regions of abundant supply or zones of hydrography-driven accumulation, floating items can be extremely abundant, exceeding 1000 items km –2 . Temporal supply of floating items is variable, being seasonal for most biotic substrata and highly sporadic for some items such as volcanic pumice. Most reported velocities of floating items are in the range of 0.5–1.0 km h –1 , but direct measurements have shown that they occasionally are transported at much faster velocities. Published trajectories of floating items also coincide with the main oceanic currents, even though strong winds may sometimes push them out of the principal current systems. Many studies hint toward floating items to link source regions with coastal sinks, in some cases across long distances and even entire ocean basins. Fossil evidence suggests that rafting has also occurred in palaeo- oceans. During recent centuries and decades the composition and abundance of floating items in the world's oceans have been strongly affected by human activities, in particular logging, river and coastline regulation, and most importantly oil exploitation and plastic production. The currently abundant supply and the characteristics of floating items suggest that rafting continues to be an important dispersal mechanism in present-day oceans.},

abstract = {Diversity, distribution and percentage cover of macroalgae on the coastline of Sirinart National Park, Thailand were studied both in the wet and dry seasons. The study was carried out on sheltered, moderately exposed and very exposed sites. Three hundred and sixty 50 cm X 50 cm quadrats were investigated. Of the more than thirty species of macroalgae found, Laurencia spp. and Padina spp. were the most common at all sites. The richest algal community, with more than eighteen species, was at the lower level of semi-exposed shore during the dry season (April 2003). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in percentage cover of seventeen macroalgal species with respect to degree of wave exposure, shore elevation, season and their interactions (P{\textless}0.05). High wave motion during the wet season was likely to play an important role in determining species diversity and the composition of macroalgae at the site. The highest diversity was found on the semi-exposed shore during the dry season, when the sea was rather calm. Surprisingly, there was greater percentage cover in the wet season, when less photosynthesis and growth were expected due to less light intensity than in the dry season, this study provides baseline data for future ecological studies and long term monitoring of macroalgal communities on tropical shores. This is the very first study of macroalgal ecology in Thailand and Southeast Asia.},

abstract = {Using a functional approach, we quantified water motion and the distribution of fish swimming modes across five habitat zones and four exposure regimes commonly found on coral reefs. There were major spatial variations in net flow velocity (7.4–43.2 cm s?1 ) and rates of flow direction change (0.06–0.66 Hz) among habitats of different depth. Water motion within the shallow crest and flat habitats appeared to be largely wave driven, with rates of flow direction change (0.63–0.66 Hz) corresponding with approximately double the wave periodicity (0.31–0.36 Hz) and relatively little contribution (14–16{\%}) from drift flow velocities. A similar variation in water motion was found among reefs of different exposure, with the highest and lowest velocities recorded in the exposed and sheltered locations, respectively. Exposed and oblique reef crests displayed greater temporal variation in wave height and water motion (24.4–59.5 cm s?1 net velocities) when compared with the relatively static conditions in sheltered (6.2–12.6 cm s?1 ) and lagoonal sites (17.1–25.3 cm s?1 ). We examined the distribution and functional structure of seven coral reef fish families (156 species) across the full range of water motion variation on these reefs. Pectoral- swimming fishes were the most abundant group, predominating in areas with high levels of water motion; pectoral- caudal– and caudal-swimming fishes displayed the opposite trend. We suggest that these differences are the result of an interaction between water motion and the biomechanical and energetic attributes associated with each swim- ming mode. Wave},

abstract = {A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was used to study the relative impact of (1) vegetation, (2) micro-topography, and (3) water level fluctuations on the spatial flow and sedimentation patterns in a tidal marsh landscape during single inundation events. The model incorporates three-dimensional (3-D) effects of vegetation on the flow (drag and turbulence). After extensive calibration and validation against field data, the model showed that the 3-D vegetation structure is determinant for the flow and sedimentation patterns. As long as the water level is below the top of the vegetation, differences in flow resistance between vegetated and unvegetated areas result in faster flow routing over unvegetated areas, so that vegetated areas are flooded from unvegetated areas, with flow directions more or less perpendicular to the vegetation edge. At the vegetation edge, flow velocities are reduced and sediments are rapidly trapped. In contrast, in between vegetated areas, flow velocities are enhanced, resulting in reduced sedimentation or erosion. As the water level overtops the vegetation, the flow paths described above change to more large-scale sheet flow crossing both vegetated and unvegetated areas. As a result, sedimentation patterns are then spatially more homogeneous. Our results suggest that the presence of a vegetation cover is the key factor controlling the long-term geomorphic development of tidal marsh landforms, leading to the formation of (1) unvegetated tidal channels and (2) vegetated platforms with a levee-basin topography in between these channels.},

Fifteen morphological characters were measured on individuals from sites of low (2.5? 0.8 S.E.) and high (12.2? 2.0 S.E.) wave exposure (Baardseth's index) within six locations in southwestern Australia. With the exception of lateralwidth (P = 0.0001), noneof themorphological characterswere consistently statistically different (P {\textgreater} 0.06) between high and low wave exposure and correlations with wave exposure were generally weak (r {\textless} 0.60).While 12 of the 15 characters were statistically different (P {\textless} 0.008) between sites of different exposure within at least one location, the direction of difference (significant or not) was opposite between some locations for all but one character (lateral width).

The ability of encrusting corallines to monopolize and retain space without overgrowth depended on the presence of shade (positive effect) if sediment deposition was below that observed on coast characterized by high rates of sedimentation (negative effect). In contrast, the growth and persistence of articulated corallines depended on the absence of shade (negative effect) and high levels of sediment accumulation observed on human-dominated coast (positive effect). The recruitment of filamentous-turfs was facil- itated by full light, but was not strongly affected by sedimentation. Instead, filamentous-turfs toler- ated heavy sediment accumulation, a factor thought to explain the concomitant increase in spatial dominance of algal-turfs and loss of canopy-forming algae on reefs with heavy sedimentation. Impor- tantly, different habitats will assemble or be maintained to match the environmental conditions in which they are most extensive, demonstrating the key role of physical factors associated with habi- tat-formers (kelp forests) and human-dominated coast (heavy sedimentation). These results also demonstrate that an appreciation of the integrated roles of physical processes may assist the devel- opment of predictive models about the assembly and maintenance of heterogeneity of natural com- munities, and their potential disruption by humans.

Based on the study of daily input loads to beaches, we estimated summer wrack deposition of up to 140 Mg (dry mass)/km shoreline in Barkley Sound, British Columbia. However, input rates were highly variable depending on beach type, nearshore hydrodynamics, and buoyancy characteristics of the wrack. Cobble beaches retained ϳ10 times and 30 times more wrack than did gravel and sand beaches, respectively. Cobble and gravel beaches also differed in species composition of new (fresh) wrack input, with Ma-crocystis integrifolia being characteristic for the former and Nereocystis luetkeana for the latter, which we attribute to buoyancy characteristics of the floating debris. On sand beaches, Phyllospadix spp. and Enteromorpha spp. were the dominant wrack species. Species com-position of freshly deposited wrack also depended on wave exposure, but predictability based on the species pool within a beach's catchment was restricted. Drift lines of aging wrack differed from freshly deposited wrack in species composition, probably due to wrack decomposition that results in fluxes of nutrients and energy between the adjacent marine and terrestrial habitats. We hold that the characteristics of a given beach, e.g., substratum and wave exposure, and their effects on wrack input, will have important ecological and biogeochemical implications for the marine–terrestrial ecotone.},

Treatment of U. australis, A. anceps and C. officinalis with antibiotics to reduce bacterial films on the surface did not reduce the settlement response of H. rubra larvae. Similarly, treatment of these species and encrusting coralline algae with germanium dioxide to reduce diatom growth did not significantly reduce larval settlement.

abstract = {We compared populations of Laminaria hyperborea from different regions along the Norwegian coast (58–71?N). The aim of the study was to examine possible regional differences in population demography and to relate these to latitudinal gradients in ambient temperature and light. A number of population parameters were examined in understory and canopy kelp individuals. We found latitudinal differences in stipe growth rate and growth pattern, mortality, lon- gevity, recruitment and density. Stipe growth rate was higher for young individuals in mid-Norway than in south and north Norway. Mean stipe length was related to temperature and light, and correlated significantly with indices combining temperature during the growth season and daylength in summer. Mortality decreased and longevity increased with increasing latitude, prob- ably because of a temperature decrease with increasing latitude and a general reduction in metabolic rate. Greater longevity may also cause the observed decrease in recruitment rate with increasing latitude, since there are fewer opportunities for understory individuals to replace dead canopy individuals. The development of particularly large kelp in mid-Norway appears to be explained by high growth rates and not a particularly long life span, as earlier assumed. This has consequences for decisions of the optimal harvesting regime for the species in the region, with regard to yield and mainte- nance of associated biodiversity. Communicated},

abstract = {Abstract Benthic maps provide the spatial framework for many science and management activities in coastal areas such as identification and protection of fish distributions and associated habitat as well as for monitoring changes in benthos and fish communities. To meet this need at Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary off the Georgia, U.S.A., coast, we created fine-scale benthic maps by visual interpretation of sonar imagery within a geographic information system. The major bottom types in the sanctuary—flat sand, rippled sand, hard bottom that is sparsely colonized with sessile invertebrates, and densely colonized hard bottom—were delineated through combined analysis of backscatter from side-scan sonar, bathymetry from multibeam sonar, scuba surveys, and video transects. Maps showed that unconsolidated sediments cover 75{\%} of the bottom of this region; 8{\%} occurs as flat sand plains with obvious burrowing and reworking of surface material by mobile benthic invertebrates, whereas 67{\%} occurs as rippled sand...},

abstract = {Sea urchins can exert a profound influence on temperate reefs, but the extent of their influence also varies considerably among geographic locations. Here, we describe the influence of the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma on attached macroalgae and drift macrophytes at a subtidal rocky reef in south-western Australia. In one experiment, we manipulated the density of H. erythrogramma in fenced plots; in a second, we manipulated the presence and absence of H. erythrogramma in unfenced plots. The manipulation of H. erythrogramma density did not result in changes in attached macroalgal biomass, but the treatment with the highest density of sea urchins had a greater drift macrophyte biomass. When H. erythrogramma was removed from unfenced plots, a slightly higher macroalgal biomass was observed in the austral summer, but this difference was not present a few months later. However, the drift biomass was 4 times higher in plots where sea urchins were not removed. The dominant macrophyte species in the drift were scarce or absent from the assemblage growing attached to the reef, suggesting that much of the drift originated elsewhere, either in adjacent seagrass beds or on reefs hundreds of metres to kilometres away. There was a disproportionate retention of drift kelp Ecklonia radiata by H. erythrogramma . Based on these results, we propose that spatial subsidies in the form of drift macroalgae result in a weak influence of H. erythrogramma on attached macroalgae},

abstract = {This study examined the consistency of the effect of wave exposure on the morphology of Ecklonia radiata, a small kelp, across a broad geographic range ({\textgreater}1100 km). Fifteen morphological characters were measured on individuals from sites of low (2.5 ?? 0.8 S.E.) and high (12.2 ?? 2.0 S.E.) wave exposure (Baardseth's index) within six locations in southwestern Australia. With the exception of lateral width (P = 0.0001), none of the morphological characters were consistently statistically different (P {\textgreater} 0.06) between high and low wave exposure and correlations with wave exposure were generally weak (r {\textless} 0.60). While 12 of the 15 characters were statistically different (P {\textless} 0.008) between sites of different exposure within at least one location, the direction of difference (significant or not) was opposite between some locations for all but one character (lateral width). ANOSIM was not able to separate thalli from high and low exposure when all locations were pooled (Clarke's R = 0.127), but within each location most sites showed better separation (0.126 {\textless} Clarke's R {\textless} 0.829). Despite the lack of statistical differences, trends suggested that E. radiata responds to exposure by having drag-reducing (small size, narrow laterals and blades, low spinosity) and strength-increasing (relatively large holdfast, thick stipe and thick blades and lamina) morphological traits, as observed for several other kelps in small-scale studies. We conclude that while wave exposure does have an effect on kelp morphology, the effect is not independent of other location-specific processes. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For example, endangered species laws and regulations and other conservation statutes typically fail to con- sider the interactions of strongly interacting species, probably because the importance of such interactions was not well understood when the laws were drafted. By failing to consider current knowledge, therefore, natural resource scientists and managers may be harming the species and systems they are charged with protecting.Most ecologists agree that the conservation of biodiversity is facilitated by maintaining population densities and distributions of strongly interactive species above estimable thresholds for ecological effectiveness. Assuming that conservation biologists and nat- ural resource managers are “physicians to nature,” we therefore propose they are obligated to adhere to a doctrine of “best conservation practices based on the best science,” applying a more rigorous standard for the management of relatively interactive species than may be mandated by older statutes and effected by current practice and convention.

abstract = {Stands of the southern bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica (Chamisso) Hariot provide considerable biomass and a major habitat in the lower intertidal zone of exposed shores on the austral land masses. Whiplash effects of adult fronds (up to 10 m long) can affect recruitment, growth and survival of understorey species and potentially large brown algal competitors, thereby affecting community development. In southern New Zealand, D. antarctica is one of several species of large brown algae inhabiting the low intertidal zone. Effects of its canopy and its associated understorey coralline algae on community development were tested at 2 sites (Moeraki and Kaikoura) at different times of year between February 1999 and October 2001. Removal of D, antarctica canopies had surprising results compared to most studies where canopies of large brown algae were removed. The greatest initial recruitment of bull kelp occurred beneath intact canopies, usually in areas where corallines were removed. Recruitment was highly variable through time, with peaks occurring in June and October (austral winter-spring), depending mostly on when canopies were removed. There was an order of magnitude difference in recruitment between sites. The cover of turfing coralline algae, however, increased in all canopy removal treatments. A major source of mortality of young recruits was grazing by the herbivorous fish Odax pullus. Its distinct grazing marks were seen on recruits, almost exclusively outside the canopy of bull kelp where 80{\%} of recruits were grazed. We show that D. antarctica has the ability to recruit beneath adult canopies, but that survival and growth ultimately depend on the extent of canopies, underlaying benthic algae and escapes from grazing by herbivorous fish.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial control region (mtDNA CR) diversity within and among 6 seahorse populations associated with the Indo-Pacific Hippocampus kuda complex (H. kuda from India, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, H. fuscus from the Red Sea and H. capensis from South Africa) was compared to determine whether there was support for the hypothesis that seahorses are able to colonize remote areas by means of rafting. Analyses performed on the data-set included phylogenetic reconstructions, estimation of relative population ages, tests for evidence of population expansion, pairwise migration rates and divergence times, as well as relationships between genetic and geographic distances. The mtDNA data indicate that all populations have undergone recent expansions, but that the timing of these events differed. The H. kuda population from India was found to be the oldest, whereas the expansion of the H. fuscus population from the Red Sea took place most recently. The fact that all seahorse populations studied are characterized by a single ancestral mtDNA haplotype and migration rates are low in most cases, as well as the fact that no significant relationship between genetic and geographic distances was found, indicates that colonization of distant habitats by a small number of founding individuals may be common in seahorses associated with the H. kuda complex. As the level of subsequent gene flow among populations is low, this may result in rapid speciation.},

In contrast with the terrestrial$\backslash$ncase, where 'long distance dispersal' (LDD) has traditionally been$\backslash$nviewed as a process involving rare events, this creates the possibility$\backslash$nfor large numbers of offspring to travel far relative to the spatial$\backslash$nscale of adult populations. As a result, the concept of LDD must$\backslash$nbe examined carefully when applied in a marine context.

abstract = {The environmental sensitivies of cold-water corals and their associated biota are likely to be determined by the natural variability of the cold-water coral reef environment. The sensitivity of reef biota to sedimentation and resuspension events is largely unknown and the influence of seasonal phytodetrital deposition is poorly understood. Here we describe the use of a benthic photolander to monitor this variability by the Sula Ridge reef complex on the mid-Norwegian continental shelf and from the Galway carbonate mound in the Porcupine Seabight. The photolander provides a platform for time-lapse digital and film cameras to image the seabed while recording the current regime and optical characteristics (light transmission, backscatter and fluorescence) of the seawater. In its first two deployments carried out in 2001 and 2002 by the Sula Ridge the lander recorded a dynamic environment around the reef site with a tidal current regime and periods of sediment resuspension. Current speeds by the Sula Ridge reef complex reached a maximum of 28 cm s(-1) and 70 cm s(-1) on the Galway carbonate mound, reinforcing much speculation about the dependence of these communities on current-swept conditions. Seabed photographs show intense feeding activity of echiuran worms (Bonellia viridis) near the Sula Ridge reef complex pointing to rapid bioturbation of the sediment. Fish were recorded sheltering near sponges that had colonised glacial dropstones. Longer term monitoring in situ is needed for study of seasonal change, to identify functional roles of associated fauna and to monitor potential coral spawning events. Benthic landers and seafloor observatories have great potential in these areas. Only with a better understanding of the natural variability of the cold-water coral environment can informed decisions about the environmental sensitivity of cold-water coral reefs and their management be made.},

abstract = {We use data from San Miguel Island shell middens spanning much of the past 10,000 years in a preliminary exploration of long-term ecological relationships between humans, sea otters (Enhydra lutris), shellfish, and kelp forests. At Daisy Cave, human use of marine habitats begins almost 11,500 years ago, with the earliest evidence for shellfish harvesting (11,500 cal BP), intensive kelp bed fishing (ca. 10,000-8500 cal BP), and Sea Otter hunting (ca. 8900 cal BP) from the Pacific Coast of North America. On San Miguel Island, Native Americans appear to have coexisted with sea otters and productive shellfish populations for over 9,000 years, but the emphasis of shellfish harvesting changed over time. Knowledge of modern sea otter behavior and ecology suggests that shell middens dominated by large red abalone shells—relatively common on San Miguel between about 7,300 and 3,300 years ago—are only likely to have formed in areas where sea otter populations had been reduced by Native hunting or other causes. Preliminary analysis of sea urchin lenses, in which the remains of urchins are unusually abundant, may also signal an increasing impact of Island Chumash populations on kelp forest and other near shore habitats during the late Holocene. Such impacts were probably relatively limited, however, when compared to the rapid and severe disruption caused by commercial exploitation under the Spanish, Mexican, and American regimes of historic times.},

Morphological variation of Ecklonia radiata has been described over thousands of kilometres of the temperate Australian coastline; however, the degree to which this morphological variability is related to geographic and environmental variation is unknown.We tested the hypotheses that: (1) variation in the morphology of Ecklonia radiata, growing in both monospecific and mixed stands, is related to variation in latitude, longitude,wave exposure, temperature, depth and plant density (collectively referred to as ‘physical variables'); and (2) measures of morphological dissimilarity in E. radiata are greatest among locations that are separated by the largest geographic distances. The combined effect of the physical variables accounted for 74{\%} of the variation in both monospecific and mixed stands. The majority of this variation was related to longitude and the remainder to wave exposure, water temperature and plant density. In monospecific stands, measures of morphological dissimilarity were consistently large between locations that were separated by the greatest geographical distances ({\textgreater}2500 km). The existence of such relationships may not indicate causality, but do contribute to a broad based understanding of major ecological patterns across temperate Australia's coastline.},
annote = {{\textgreater} Marine algae typically occupy broad geographic ranges that are exposed to a wide variety of physical environments and commonly exhibit variation in morphology. 

{\textgreater} A range of variables have been identified as inlfuencing morphology of marine macroalgae and include: Hydrodynamic forces, sea water nutrient concentrations, salinity and temperature, plant density, depth and light, grazing pressure and competition. 

{\textgreater} Across Australia, there are striking intraspecific variability in morphology of brown alga Ecklonia radiata.

{\textgreater} This study attempts to couple the morphological variation of E. radiata across temperate Australia to geographic and environmental variables. We specifically test the hypothesis, in both monospecific and mixed stands, that variation in the morphology of E. radiata across temperate Australia is related to variation in latitude, longitude, wave exposure, temperature, depth and plant density. We also test the hypothesis that measures of morphological dissimilarity in E. radiata are greatest among locations that are seperated by the largest geographical distances. 

{\textgreater} In the present study, wave exposure was related to a substantial amount of morphological variation in both monospecific and mixed stands. 

{\textgreater} morphology between monospecific and mixed stands was consistent with environmental gradients shown in previous studies. 

{\textgreater}PLants growing in high densities, in both monospecific and mixed stands, were generally smaller in weight, surface area, width and holdfast size. In monospecific stands, plants growing at higher densities were also greater in total plant, lamina and stipe length, but in mixed stands they wre shorter in such length measurements. IN terrestrial systems, trees ihabiting dense stands wihin a forest tend to allocate proportionally more biomass to height than to thickness, in response to increased shade and/or protection from wind afforded by neighbouring trees. Similary, in marine systems, longer and thinner morphologies are common in high density compared to low density stands.},

In all, 10 confirmed extant alien and 22 cryptogenic species are recorded from the region. All 10 alien species support well-established populations and the majority of these remain restricted in distribution to sheltered bays, estuaries and harbours. Only one species, the Medite- rranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, has spread extensively along the coast and caused significant eco- logical impacts. These include the competitive displace- ment of indigenous species and a dramatic increase in intertidal mussel biomass. These changes have also increased available habitat for many infaunal species and resulted in enhanced food supply for intertidal preda- tors. Considerable economic benefits have also resulted from this invasion because M. galloprovincialis forms the basis of the South African mussel culture industry.},

abstract = {Macroalgal canopies modify their surrounding environment and thereby influence the structure of associated algal assemblages. Canopies can modify many factors that can be hard to separate and, consequently, the importance of individual factors often remains unknown. Experiments were carried out to test the hypotheses that Ecklonia radiata canopies modify light, sediment cover and water motion, and that each of these physical factors separately influence the assemblage of associated foliose algae. We measured light, sediment cover and water motion across six naturally occurring E. radiata densities and found a reduction in light and sediment cover as kelp density increased. The outcome for water motion was inconclusive. We also manipulated each of these three factors, while controlling for the two others, to determine the separate effects of light, sediment cover and water motion on the assemblage of foliose algae. Reduction in light had a strong effect on the foliose assemblage, reducing species richness and biomass. Reduction in sediment cover and water motion did not cause separate effects at the level of the assemblage, but the biomass of individual species of foliose algae indicated both positive and negative effects. We conclude that E. radiata canopies at Marmion, Western Australia, modify at least two factors of their physical environment, light and sediment cover. However, only light is modified to an extent where it has effects at the assemblage-level because, in contrast to the effects of sediment cover and water motion, the direction of responses are consistent among individual species of algae.},

abstract = {This study quantified the prevalence of holdfast aggregation (fusion of holdfasts) for the kelp Ecklonia radiata on subtidal reefs in southwestern Australia, and tested whether morphology, age, attachment or drag were different between kelps growing alone (solitary) or in aggregates. Wave-sheltered in-shore reefs consistently had fewer aggregates than wave-exposed off-shore reefs (15-20{\%} versus 20-30{\%}). On average, individual thalli from aggregates were longer (97.8 cm ?? 2.2 S.E. versus 88.0 cm ?? 2.0 S.E.) and had smaller holdfasts (32.9 g fresh wt ?? 1.7 S.E. versus 45.8 g fresh wt ?? 2.9 S.E.) than solitary thalli, whereas there were no significant differences in other morphological characters, including total biomass (805.1 g fresh wt ?? 38.7 S.E. versus 831.5 g fresh wt ?? 38.5 S.E.), stipe length (7.93 cm ?? 0.47 S.E. versus 7.65 cm ?? 0.40 S.E.) and stipe diameter (12.6 mm ?? 0.23 S.E. versus 13.0 mm ?? 0.25 S.E.). There was no difference in age between solitary (2.7-3.0 years) and aggregated (2.4-2.8 years) individuals. While the attachment force of whole aggregates (256.5 N ?? 21.6 S.E.) was found to be significantly larger than attachment force for solitary individuals (162.5 N ?? 12.9 S.E.), attachment areas were also larger for aggregates (90.7 cm2 ?? 5.40 S.E. versus 64.3 cm2 ?? 5.54 S.E.) and consequently there were no differences in attachment strength between aggregates (2.92 N cm -2 ?? 0.26 S.E.) and solitary thalli (2.71 N cm-2 ?? 0.22 S.E.). Aggregates had significantly smaller (17{\%}) roughness factors (equivalent to drag coefficients) than solitary individuals and a negative relationship (r = -0.68) between roughness factors and biomass suggested that this was related to the scope for compaction and rearrangement of the thalli. Further, there was no relationship between roughness factors of solitary individuals and the aggregates they produced when combined, suggesting that roughness factors are not additive or multiplicative. The spatial distribution of holdfast aggregates, the morphological differences between solitary and aggregated individuals as well as their attachment and drag characteristics were all consistent with aggregation reducing the rate of fatal kelp dislodgment. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Over-harvesting, habitat loss and exotic invasions have altered predator diversity and composition in a variety of communities which is predicted to affect other trophic levels and ecosystem functioning. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating predator identity and diversity in outdoor mesocosms that contained five species of macroalgae and a macroinvertebrate herbivore assemblage dominated by amphipods and isopods. We used five common predators including four carnivores (crabs, shrimp, blennies and killifish) and one omnivore (pinfish). Three carnivorous predators each induced a strong trophic cascade by reducing herbivore abundance and increasing algal biomass and diversity. Surprisingly, increasing predator diversity reversed these effects on macroalgae and altered algal composition, largely due to the inclusion and performance of omnivorous fish in diverse predator assemblages. Changes in predator diversity can cascade to lower trophic levels; the exact effects, however, will be difficult to predict due to the many complex interactions that occur in diverse food webs.},

abstract = {Ecklonia maxima is an economically important kelp in South Africa. The harvested kelp is used mainly as feed for cultured Haliotis midae (abalone) on farms all along the South African South and West Coast. The effects that different harvesting methods have on the growth of sub-canopy kelps, kelp population structure and kelp recruitment were tested in a kelp bed at Bordjies Rif near Cape Town. Two 30 × 10 m sites were set up, about 100m apart, in near monoculture stands of E. maxima. Each 30×10m area was subdivided into three treatments. In treatment 1 (T1) the whole ‘head' of each kelp sporophyte that reached the surface was cut off between the bulb and the primary blade (‘lethal' method). In treatment 2 (T2) (‘non-lethal' method), the secondary fronds of all sporophytes that reached the surface were cut 20–30cm from their junction with the primary blade, and removed. In the control plot, the kelp plants were not treated. Harvesting treatments were done approximately every four months, at low spring tide, from 3 March 2003 to 3 November 2003 (three treatments). The effects of harvesting on the kelps depend largely on the size of plant and the time the fronds were removed; however, no seasonal pattern could be observed. The different treatments had no effect on the growth rate, population structure or recruitment of the kelp. This means that factors other than light play an important role in the growth, structure and recruitment of the kelp beds in False Bay. Results are discussed in relation to current commercial harvesting practices.},

The floras of different Arabian localities across this floristic break were compared using macrophyte distribution data throughout the Indian Ocean and seasonal sea-surface temperature (SST) data. The localities from the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman differ significantly from those of the Arabian Sea based on their species richness, species composition, average distribution range per species, general temperature affinity of the composing species, and seasonal temperature data of the coastal waters. Pooling the temperature data into two groups (SST3avg, average SST of the three warmest seasons; SSTmin, minimum of the seasonal SSTs) revealed a temperature limit at 28 degrees C using both the temperature affinity data of the floras and the seasonal temperatures recorded for the specific Arabian localities, which significantly separates the Arabian Sea from localities of both Gulfs. Finally, SST data of the Indian Ocean were analyzed using this upper temperature threshold of macrophytes at 28 degrees C and the lower temperature limit of corals at 25 degrees C, revealing general macrophyte diversity patterns.},

abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living},
annote = {From Duplicate 2 (The impacts of climate change in coastal marine systems: Climate change in coastal marine systems - Harley, C D G; Randall Hughes, A; Hultgren, K M; Miner, B G; Sorte, C J B; Thornber, C S; Rodriguez, L F; Tomanek, L; Williams, S L)

Much of the past research has focused on temperature and its relationship with organisms and their distributions and physiological functioning. However these simplistic relationships are not able to predict future climate scenarios; there are many aspects that may affect species. Temperature is is only one aspect. 

Warming trends are expected to be stronger over continental interiors than over oceans = increase in intensity of wind fields which may lead to an increase in nutrient availability at the surface. However deepening of the thermocline and stronger thermal stratification may prevent upwelling in future scenarios. 

Chemically - driven changes

{\textgreater} Rise in CO2 = drop in pH of the oceans
{\textgreater} decrease in pH will lead to changes in saturation horizons of aragonite, calcite, and other minerals important for calcifying organisms.
{\textgreater} CO2 will also deplete ozone layer = increase in ultra violate radiation

Ecological responses to climate change

{\textgreater} Direct effects = impacts on organisms performance in life history stages, physiological, morphological, and behavioral
{\textgreater} Population level = changes in transport processes that influence dispersal and recruitment 
{\textgreater} Community level (mediated by interacting species) = changes in abundance and per capita interaction strength of interacting species.

All of the above affect species distributions, biodiversity, productivity and micro-evolutionary processes.

Responses to: Temperature 

{\textgreater} Affects physiological processes
{\textgreater} Performance and survival
{\textgreater} Affects certain ontogenetic stages differently
{\textgreater} Can also affect the timing of ontogenetic processes
{\textgreater} Community level changes

Sea level Rise

{\textgreater} Upward shift in species distributions; Most species are expected to keep up with predicted changes, however slow growing and long lived organisms may be more vulnerable
{\textgreater} Decrease in habitat availability eg: intertidal habitat may be reduced by 20-70{\%} over the next 100 years in North American Bays. 

Changes in Circulation

{\textgreater} Increase in storms will lead to an increase in hydrodynamic disturbance, furthermore an increase in storm frequency may reduce the odds of recovery
{\textgreater} Possible shifts in nutrient supply
{\textgreater} Shifts in oceanographic patterns

CO2 and pH change

{\textgreater} Terrestial systems may be positively impacted by the increase in CO2, however marine plants (except Seagrams) are carbon saturated and therefore enhanced growth rates are not expected.
{\textgreater} Rise in CO2 has significant implications for physiolgical processes in marine organisms.
{\textgreater} Impacts may be disproportional among taxa

UV change

{\textgreater} Increase in UV 
{\textgreater} May affect invert rate larvae and algae 

Emergent ecological responses

{\textgreater} Zonation patterns are most likely going to shift
{\textgreater} Biogeographical range shifts will occur; there are contemporary examples of this
{\textgreater} Most species are expected to shift polewards (evidence of past relationship in fossil record) 

Changes in species composition, diversity and community structure

{\textgreater} Exploitation, habitat destruction/alteration and pollution is reducing the abundance of many marine species and increasing the likelihood of local extinctions (however no extinctions have been directly attributed to climate change) 
{\textgreater} Some marine systems have low functional diversity; I.e the loss of even one species can cause a important community and ecosystem consequences. 

Changes in primary and secondary production

These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species{\AE} ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level},

In southeast Alaska two species of floating kelps, Nereocystis luetkeana and Alaria fistulosa, have been commercially harvested since 1992 for use as agrochemicals by the Alaska Kelp Company. However, there is currently no harvest management plan for this fishery. The lack of a formalized management plan is one factor that has kept the kelp industry from expanding in the state. We have employed an aerial digital multispectral imaging system (DMSC) calibrated with ground truthing for performing such an assessment. The system can be flown at varying altitudes to achieve spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 2 m. Rapid ground truthing techniques were developed using morphometric measurements to predict biomass. Analysis of the DMSC imagery showed that good correlations could be developed between the multispectral imagery and kelp biomass estimates collected at the ground-truth sites. Repeatable estimates of kelp bed area derived from the multispectral imagery could be made at varying tidal levels. However, broad scale maps of kelp biomass suitable for estimating harvest rates could not be made at different tide levels. Multispectral imagery suitable for this purpose must be collected at a standard tidal level.},

abstract = {Declines in coral cover are generally associated with increases in the abundance of fleshy algae. In many cases, it remains unclear whether algae are responsible, directly or indirectly, for coral death or whether they simply settle on dead coral surfaces. Here, we show that algae can indirectly cause coral mortality by enhancing microbial activity via the release of dissolved compounds. When coral and algae were placed in chambers together but separated by a 0.02 mum filter, corals suffered 100{\%} mortality. With the addition of the broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin, mortality was completely prevented. Physiological measurements showed complementary patterns of increasing coral stress with proximity to algae. Our results suggest that as human impacts increase and algae become more abundant on reefs a positive feedback loop may be created whereby compounds released by algae enhance microbial activity on live coral surfaces causing mortality of corals and further algal growth.},

abstract = {Passively dispersing propagules are often transported across a range of scales, with impacts on local processes tied to the density of settlement, and on regional processes influencing population connectivity. This dual set of effects has spurred research targeting both short- and long-distance ends of the dispersal spectrum. To date, however, dispersal distributions have been rigorously quantified primarily in terrestrial plants with seeds. Dispersal distributions in the ocean are by comparison poorly defined. This limitation arises with particular force in the habitat-forming giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, where complex coastal flows affect self-fertilization and inbreeding depression near to a source, as well as propagule delivery dictating recovery of locally extinct populations farther away. Here we use a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to examine spore dispersal in Macrocystis. Results from a physically based model, parameterized via field-measured hydrodynamics, are compared to settlement data gathered at the same experimental site using spore collectors positioned around solitary kelps and an experimental kelp forest. Theoretical and empirical findings are synthesized, and the ability of simple phenomenological expressions to represent short- and long-distance spore dispersal is examined. Results demonstrate that short- distance dispersal patterns quantified over brief durations are noisy due to stochastic effects of turbulence. Waves can further smear distributions, reducing distinctions between dispersal from point sources (e.g., solitary kelps) vs. area sources (e.g., entire forests). Temporally averaged dispersal distributions follow a lognormal-Gaussian form that is explicitly coupled to current speed. Analyses based on this phenomenological expression provide first-order benchmarks useful in several contexts. Calculations suggest a tremendous rate of spore release in Macrocystis, exceeding 10(8) spores per individual per day. Routine fertilization and recruitment appear possible at distances beyond 1 km from many beds, modulated by current speed, forest size, and the duration of viability of gamete-producing life stages derived from spores. Within Macrocystis forests where settlement densities are high, selfing levels on the order of 10{\%} or more may arise. These characteristics influence patterns of propagule supply, population connectivity, and inbreeding in this key nearshore seaweed, while also revealing trends in the mechanics of propagule dispersal more generally.},

abstract = {In the first half of the twentieth century, developmental biology and genetics were separate disciplines. The word epigenetics was coined by Waddington to link the two fields. Epigenetics could be broadly defined as the sum of all those mechanisms necessary for the unfolding of the genetic programme for development. Several decades later specific mechanisms were proposed in which information was superimposed on DNA sequences. In particular, it was suggested that 5-methyl cytosine had a role in controlling gene expression, and also that the pattern of methylation was heritable. These predictions are now supported by a large body of evidence which shows that methylation is strongly associated with gene silencing in a variety of biological contexts. There are now also many examples of epigenetic inheritance through the germ line There are several other important epigenetic mechanisms involving chromatin and histone modifications, and also the expanding field of regulatory RNAs. The human epigenome project will unravel the pattern of DNA methylation in different tissues, and will this determine whether the regulation of gene expression is at the level of DNA or chromatin, or both.},

PM10concentrations at Heraklion (51±33 $\mu$g m-3) and Finokalia (28±30 $\mu$g m-3) lie within the range found for urban and background-rural sites in the Eastern Mediterranean, respectively. Special focus has been given to the influence of transported dust from N. Africa, which is found to be more frequent during spring and fall. The additional effect from local sources has been also calculated at Heraklion (about 20 $\mu$g m-3). The EU limit of 50 $\mu$g m-3is exceeded at Heraklion, one in 4 days, during winter and spring (50{\%} due to transported dust) and half of the days during summer and fall (pollution). At Finokalia exceedances are observed in winter and spring during one in 5 days, 80-100{\%} of which are associated with dust events. The mass balance estimation for periods with no influence from dust shows that ions dominate the PM10mass (40-60{\%}) with dust and particulate carbonaceous matter (PCM) comprising the rest. During the identified dust outbreaks, the contribution of dust rises to 60-65{\%}, while the contribution of ions declines to 30{\%} and only 10{\%} is PCM. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The 1997-98 El Nino was one of the strongest on record and resulted in widespread losses of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Agardh) along the west coast of North America. Drawing on a rich history of studies that have shown abnormally large waves and warm nutrient-poor water associated with El Ninos to negatively impact giant kelp populations at some locations in southern and Baja California, we examined (1) how these impacts scale up when considered across the species' geographic range in the NE Pacific Ocean and (2) if these impacts are generalizable over broad spatial scales. Working at 56 sites in 14 study locations over a 3 yr period (1997 to 2000), we examined how giant kelp populations were impacted by and recovered following the 1997-98 El Niho over a similar to 1500 km span along the west coast of North America. Our results indicate that while nearly all giant kelp disappeared from the southern one-third of the species' range along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and heavy losses occurred throughout the central one-third of the species' range in southern California, USA, only minor impacts were observed throughout the northern one-third of the species' range in central California. Further, although highly variable among regions, these impacts were similar and generalizable among locations within each region. Our results also suggest that, as has been observed in local-scale studies, this large-scale variability in giant kelp mortality was driven by large-scale patterns in ocean temperature (nutrient concentration) and wave intensity. Recovery following El Niho, in contrast, was variable at multiple spatial scales and although not directly tested here, presumably influenced by numerous factors such as proximity to upwelling areas, competition with other algae, grazing, and propagule availability. Further, variability in the rates of recovery among locations resulted in a generally slow recovery of giant kelp throughout most of Baja California, and residual large-scale impacts of the El Niho were still evident 2 yr after the El Niho ended. As global climate change may lead to increases in the frequency and intensity of El Ninos, our findings have broad implications for the ways in which ecosystems might be expected to respond to them and provide a measure by which their impacts to giant kelp ecosystems may be compared among events.},

abstract = {The Cape fur seal, Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus is distributed along the southern African coastline from northern Namibia to the south-east coast of South Africa. The species has been impacted by sealing operations since the 1600s, and historical records suggest that the taxon experienced a bottleneck prior to the 20th century. Mitochondrial DNA control region sequences were generated for 106 individuals belonging to six breeding colonies. Haplotype diversity was found to be high (0.975 +/- 0.014) whereas levels of nucleotide diversity were much lower compared to other seal species (0.011 +/- 0.006). An analysis of molecular variance indicated that the largest percentage of haplotype diversity is distributed within colonies rather than among them. This could be attributed to either extensive gene flow among colonies, a lack of substantial female site philopatry, or incomplete lineage sorting of haplotypes. Mismatch distribution and Fu's F (S) test indicated that the population has experienced a historical population expansion probably between c. 37,000-18,000 YBP and this date coincides very well with the height of the last glacial maximum when food resources were abundant in the South Atlantic. These results also suggest that the recent sealing-induced bottleneck did not have a profound influence on the haplotype diversity and a historical bottleneck prior to a demographic expansion may have been severe enough to reduce nucleotide diversity substantially.},

With a rapid decline in wild abalone fisheries, farming now dominates the abalone export market in South Africa. Kelp (Ecklonia maxima) constitutes the major feed for farmed abalone in South Africa, but this resource is now approaching limits of sustainable harvesting in kelp Concession Areas where abalone farms are concentrated. This paper gives an overview of the development of the South African abalone industry and analyses how abalone farming, natural kelp beds and seaweed harvesting are interlinked. It discusses options and constraints for expanding the abalone industry, focussing especially on abalone feed development to meet this growing demand. Kelp will continue to play an important role as feed and kelp areas previously not utilised may become cost-effective to harvest. There are many benefits from on-farm seaweed production and it will probably be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry. Abalone waste discharges are not at present regarded as a major concern and farming brings important employment opportunities to lower income groups in remote coastal communities and has positive spillover effects on the seaweed industry and abalone processing industry. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The green macroalga, Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, is an important component of sheltered low-shore assemblages on breakwaters along sandy shores in the northern Adriatic Sea. Macroscopic thalli of C. fragile are not perennial, but develop from propagules and/or undifferentiated forms in early spring, when the dominant native space-occupier, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, recruits. By mid-summer, rapid growth of C. fragile leads to the formation of a dense canopy. We investigated the effects of juvenile and adult thalli of C. fragile on recruitment, survival and growth of mussels. Two experiments tested the hypotheses: (1) that recruitment of mussels is greater within patches of juvenile thalli (primordia) of C. fragile than on adjacent bare surfaces; (2) that the presence of a canopy of C. fragile affects the survival and growth of mussel recruits. The number of recruits of mussels was significantly larger within clumps of primordia of C. fragile than on bare surfaces. The removal of the canopy of C. fragile affected negatively the density of mussels after 2 months from the start of the experiment, but there were no effects on the mean size of individuals, nor on the size-frequency distribution. The same trend persisted after 4 months from the start of the experiment. These results show that re-colonisation of space by mussels is enhanced by C. fragile. Given that mussels, in turn, have the potential to reduce recruitment rates of C. fragile, quick recovery of mussel beds after disturbances could be crucial for controlling the abundance of this alga on breakwaters. Results also suggest that the effects of introduced species on native assemblages can be explained only through studies encompassing different life-stages of interacting organisms.},

abstract = {Modification of the coastal environment by human activities often leads to an increase in sedimentation of nearshore waters, with potential impacts on benthic marine assemblages. Here we assess the relationships between the levels of sedimentation, wave exposure and benthic organisms on rocky intertidal platforms around the Kaikoura Peninsula in southern New Zealand. We designed and tested five sediment traps to provide a tool for measuring the relative abundance of sediment across sites. Using field- and laboratory-based experiments, we tested hypotheses concerning whether different levels of sedimentation affected algal germling survival and algal zygote attachment, and whether the interactions of grazers and sediments affected germling survival. Levels of sediment and exposure were inversely related across seven sites. The fucoid alga Hormosira banksii characterized the more sedimented wave-sheltered and intermediately wave-exposed sites, with up to 80{\%} cover in the lower mid-tidal zone, while the bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica characterized the three most wave-exposed sites. Grazing molluscs were found across all sites but species abundances varied by sediment and exposure levels. We did two 11-day trials testing the effects of different levels of sediment and different species of molluscan grazers on the survival of 1-week-old Hormosira germlings. Generally, there was no significant treatment effect of grazers, but mortality varied considerably among sites. In particular, one site had very high levels of sediment, which resulted in 100{\%} mortality of germlings across all grazer treatments. Removing sediment at 1-week, 2-week and 4-week intervals made no difference to the survival of Hormosira germlings. In laboratory-based experiments, a light dusting of sediment reduced the percentage of zygotes of Hormosira by 34{\%} and Durvillaea by 71{\%} that attached to primary substratum, and a complete cover of sediment prevented attachment altogether. Overall, the effects of sediments and its interaction with molluscan grazing were highly variable but often large, particularly on the attachment of zygotes to primary substratum. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The ability of algae to change the shape of their thallus in response to the environment may be of functional and ecological importance to the alga, with many species of macroalgae exhibiting a great range of morphological variation across wave exposure gradients. However, differences in morphology detected between sheltered and exposed environments cannot determine whether such differences represent plastic responses to the local environment or whether morphology is genetically fixed. This study tested for differences in the morphology of the common kelp, Ecklonia radiata, between wave sheltered and exposed environments, and reciprocally transplanted juveniles to distinguish the nature of such differences (i.e. plastic vs fixed traits). Differences between exposure environments were consistent with known effects of exposure (i.e. a wide, thin thallus at sheltered sites and a narrow, thick thallus with a thick stipe at exposed sites). The reciprocal transplant experiment confirmed that morphological plasticity was the mechanism enabling this alga to display different patterns in morphology between exposure environments. Individuals transplanted to the exposed environment underwent a rapid and extreme response in morphology, which was not apparent in individuals transplanted to the sheltered environment that responded more slowly. These results suggest that stressors typical of sheltered environments (i.e. diffusion stress) may not be as influential (if at all) compared to stressors typical of exposed environments (i.e. breakage, dislodgement) in differentiating morphological characters between exposure environments.},
annote = {{\textgreater} Morphological variation enables species to occupy a broad range of physical environments and is commonly thought to enhance the survival and productivity of plants growing in physically different environments. 

{\textgreater} Kelp morphology in relation to environmental gradients have been well documented.

{\textgreater} At sheltered sites macroalgal fronds tend to be wide, thin and undulate and at exposed sites are narrow, thick, flat and thick stipes. These morphological differences are thought to enable macroalgae to inhabit wave sheltered environments without compromising photosynthetic ability and growth and wave exposed environments by reducing breakage and/or dislodgement.

{\textgreater} Due to the range in scale of studies performed on this subject, no evidence has been presented whether the these responses to environmental gradients are plastic or fixed genetic responses based on ecotype which that particular population is adapted for. 

{\textgreater} This study used a combination of observational and experimental analyses revealed that different mprhologies existed between exposed and sheltered sites.

{\textgreater} The differences in morphology is considered a plastic response to the local enviornment and did not reflect gentically fixed traits.

{\textgreater}The morphological responses exbited in this study was consistent with physiological and mechanical responses reported in other studies

{\textgreater} 11 out of 14 kelp morphology characters responded consistently to the differences in exposure. However 3 characters responded in an incosistent way (plant length, stipe length and lamina length). 

{\textgreater} The results from the transplant experiment indicate a phenotypic response to the local environment. i.e transplanted individuals did not retain characters from their naitive site. Furthermore, transplanted individuals exbited characters consistent with naturally occuring individuals. 

{\textgreater} Interestingly, individuals transplanted to wave exposed sites responded more rapidly compared to individuals transplanted to wave-sheltered sites. Furthermore, in wave exposed sites responses were sometimes over compensated for and maifested in the form of longer stipe lengths. 

{\textgreater} In conclusion, variation in morphology of E. radiata exists across southern Australia which we now understand, at the scales of km,can be driven by the xternal environment. This study suggests that the environmentally specific forms of E. radiata in wave exposed and wave sheltered environments, at scales of 1-10km, are the result of a plastic response to the exposure conditions typical of the kelp native environment. Results also suggest that stressors typical of sheltered environments (i.e diffusion stress) may not be as influential compared to stressors typical of exposed environments (i.e. breakage/dislodgment) in differentiating morphological characters between exposure environments.},

abstract = {The formation of sea urchin 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However there has been much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to sea urchin barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania. Tethered juvenile and adult sea urchins experienced much higher rates of mortality inside no-take marine reserves where sea urchin predators were abundant compared to adjacent fished areas where predators were fewer. Mortality of tagged (but not tethered) sea urchins was also notably higher in marine reserves than in adjacent areas open to fishing. When a range of sizes of sea urchins was exposed to three sizes of rock lobsters in a caging experiment, juvenile sea urchins were eaten more frequently than larger sea urchins by all sizes of rock lobster, but only the largest rock lobsters ({\textgreater} 120??mm CL) were able to consume large adult sea urchins. Tagging (but not tethering) juvenile and adult sea urchins in two separate marine reserves indicated that adult sea urchins experience higher predation mortality than juveniles, probably because juveniles can shelter in cryptic microhabitat more effectively. In a field experiment in which exposure of sea urchins to rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and demersal reef fish predators was manipulated, rock lobsters were shown to be more important than fish as predators of adult sea urchins in a marine reserve. We conclude that predators, and particularly rock lobsters, exert significant predation mortality on H. erythrogramma in Tasmanian marine reserves, and that adult sea urchins are more vulnerable than smaller cryptic individuals. Fishing of rock lobsters is likely to reduce an important component of mortality in H. erythrogramma populations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Intraspecific phylogenies can provide useful insights into how populations have been shaped by historical and contemporary processes. Taiwan formed around 5 million years ago from tectonic uplift, and has been connected to mainland Asia several times since its emergence. A central mountain range runs north to south, bisecting the island, and potentially impedes gene flow along an east-west axis. The Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros) is endemic to Taiwan, where it is found mainly at low altitude. To determine the population structure and the demographic and colonization history of this species, we examined variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region in 203 bats sampled at 26 sites. We found very high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, which decreased from the centre to the south and north. Population differentiation followed a pattern of isolation by distance, though most regional genetic variance was attributable to differences between the relatively isolated southern population and those from other regions. A haplotype network was consistent with these findings and also suggested a southward colonization, followed by subsequent secondary contact between the south and other regions. Mismatch distributions were used to infer a past population expansion predating the last glacial maximum, and a neighbour-joining tree showed that R. monoceros formed a monophyletic grouping with respect to its sister taxa. Taken together, our results suggest that this taxon arose from a single period of colonization, and that demographic growth followed in the late Pleistocene. Current genetic structure reflects limited gene flow, probably coupled with stepwise colonization in the past. We consider explanations for the persistence of the species through multiple glacial maxima.},

abstract = {In October 2004, the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) sponsored a symposium to consider "Mechanisms that regulate North Pacific ecosystems: Bottom up, top down, or something else?" It sought to examine how marine populations, particularly the upper-trophic-level species, are regulated and to understand how energy flows through marine ecosystems. This introductory essay examines aspects of control mechanisms in pelagic marine ecosystems and some of the issues discussed during the symposium and in the 11 papers that were selected for this special issue. At global scales, the greatest biomass of fishes, seabirds and marine mammals tends to occur in regions of the world ocean with high primary production, e.g., the sub-arctic seas and up-welling regions of continental shelves. These large-scale animal distribution patterns are driven by food availability, not the absence of predators. At regional scales however, it is likely that current predation or past predation events have shaped local distributions, at least in marine birds and pinnipeds. Wasp-waist control occurs when one of the intermediate trophic levels is dominated by a single species, as occurs with small pelagic fishes of the world's up-welling zones. Processes in these ecosystems may have features that result in a switch from bottom-up to top-down control. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We evaluate differences within and between kelps and fucoids in life histories as they affect population biology; dispersal and poten- tial limitations in population establishment; macroscopic stages and variations in survival and longevity affecting stand structure; and mi- croscopic stage responses to disturbance and variation in the physical environment. We suggest that the commonly made comparisons of seaweeds with terrestrial seed plants are misleading because of large differences in morphology, environments, and the ephemeral na- ture of propagule banks in the sea. We conclude that progress in understanding algal populations depends on better knowledge of microscopic stages and on feedback through density-dependent re- productive processes, dispersal, and settlement},

Yet recent large-scale studies of community regulation in marine ecosystems have shown dramatically different results that leave this issue largely unresolved. We combined a multiyear, large-scale data set of species abundances for 46 species in kelp forests from the California Channel Islands with satellite-derived primary production and found that top-down control explains 7- to 10-fold more of the variance in abundance of bottom and mid-trophic levels than does bottom-up control. This top-down control was propagated via a variety of species-level direct and indirect responses to predator abundance. Management of top-down influences such as fishing may be more important in coastal marine ecosystems, particularly in kelp forest systems, than is commonly thought.},

Molecular phylo- genies published for the ALL families have generated hypotheses strongly at odds with the cur- rent morphological taxonomy; however, conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses and consistently low levels of support realized in all of these studies have re- sulted in conservative approaches to taxonomic re- visions.

The surprising presence of such diversity amidst severe environmental adversity provides a unique opportunity for exploration of the role of extreme water flows in community ecology and natural selection. Methods are described by which the maximal water velocity and acceleration can be predicted for a site on the shore, and from these values maximal hydrodynamic forces are calculated. These forces can limit the range and foraging activity of some species, and can determine the rate of disturbance in others, but in general, wave-swept organisms have surprisingly high factors of safety. This apparent over-design can help to explain the diversity of forms present on wave- swept shores, and provides examples of how mechanics can limit the ability of natural selection to guide specialization. Although flow itself may commonly be prohibited from selecting for optima in morphology, it nonetheless continues to play a potentially important role in evolution by providing a mechanism for breaking or dislodging individuals that have been selected by other means.},

@article{Holderegger2006,
abstract = {In their inaugural paper, Manel et al. (2003) defined landscape genetics as a combination of landscape ecology and population genetics. In more detail, these authors stated that landscape genetics ‘aims at providing information about the interaction between landscape features and microevolutionary processes, such as gene flow, genetic drift and selection' (Manel et al. 2003, p. 189). The first lesson to learn from this is that we are dealing with microevolution, i.e., evolutionary processes within species. Second, we are talking about gene flow and selection, two ecological and evolutionary processes that need different genetic approaches to be investigated Holderegger et al. 2006). Third, Manel et al. (2003, p. 190) remarked that ‘the two key steps of landscape genetics are the detection of genetic discontinuities and the correlation of these discontinuities with landscape environmental features, such as barriers', which provides relevant information for various scientific disciplines such as evolution, ecology or conservation biology. Hence, we need two data sets, a genetic one and a landscape ecological one, and we look for breaks, gradients or transitions that coincide in these two data sets. Manel et al. (2003) were less explicit in their landscape definition, and landscape ecologists are well aware that this is a difficult task (Turner et al. 2001). Thus, the definition of landscape genetics by Manel et al. (2003) was much clearer on the population genetic than on the landscape ecological side, including spatial scale. A pragmatic circumscription of landscape genetics could be that landscape genetics endorses those studies that combine population genetic data, adaptive or neutral, with data on landscape composition and configuration, including matrix quality. A comparison with metapopulation biology and metapopulation genetics may clarify the major characteristic of landscape genetics. Classical metapopulation studies are spatially implicit, they view the natural world as divided into cheerful islands (patches) and hostile sea (matrix) (Baquette 2004). Spatially realistic metapopulation models typically consider the geographic distance between patches (Ovaskainen and Hanski 2004), but do not include matrix quality. In landscape genetics, however, the landscape with its composition, spatial configuration and dynamics makes up half of the story beside genetics. Landscape genetics therefore is much closer to the real world than the classical metapopulation concept. For instance, the actual connectivity of populations in terms of dispersal of organisms may deviate markedly from an abstract population genetic gene flow index (Whitlock and McCauley 1999) or from a landscape ecological connectivity index calculated from a habitat map (Li and Wu 2004). Landscape genetics provides powerful tools for quantifying such processes in real landscapes. While population geneticists have eagerly adopted this approach, landscape ecologists have only started using genetic methods. Landscape genetics is an important emerging research topic that integrates landscape pattern with population genetics. It is a new way of sci- Landscape Ecology (2006) 21:793–796 Springer 2006 DOI 10.1007/s10980-005-6058-6 entific thinking, whereas there exists neither a specific landscape genetic theory nor specific concepts. While landscape ecology partly shares these limitations (Wu and Hobbs 2002), the situation is different with population genetics, which has a well-founded theoretical basis (Hartl and Clark 1997). However, no landscape genetic research agenda has been defined to date, and landscape genetic data are still scarce. We believe that the benefit of landscape genetics lies in its heuristic, as well as practical, values of forcing landscape ecologists to think more about processes rather than spatial patterns, and to remind population geneticists that processes are affected by the quality of a landscape and not just by pure spatial distance (Holderegger et al. in press). This is new, especially when it comes to scientific practice.},

abstract = {An important aspect of particle trajectory modeling in the ocean is the assessment of the uncertainty in the final particle position. Monte Carlo particle trajectory simulations using surface currents derived from standard-range and long-range CODAR HF radar systems were performed using random-walk and random-flight models of the unresolved velocities. Velocity statistics for these models were derived from the covariance functions of differences between CODAR and drifter estimates of surface currents. Comparison of predicted trajectories and drifter tracks demonstrate that these predictions are superior to assuming the drifters stay at their initial position. Vertical shear between the effective depth of long-range CODAR measurements (∼2.4 m) and that of drifters (0.65 m) causes the drifters to move more rapidly downwind than predicted. This bias is absent when standard-range CODAR currents (effective depth ∼0.5 m) are used, implying that drifter leeway is not the cause of the bias. Particle trajectories were computed using CODAR data and the random-flight model for 24-hour intervals using a Monte Carlo approach to determine the 95{\%} confidence interval of position predictions. Between 80{\%} and 90{\%} of real drifters were located within the predicted confidence interval, in reasonable agreement with the expected 95{\%} success rate. In contrast, predictions using the random-walk approach proved inconsistent with observations unless the diffusion coefficient was increased to approximately the random-flight value. The consistency of the random-flight uncertainty estimates and drifter data supports the use of our methodology for estimating model parameters from drifter-CODAR velocity differences.},

abstract = {We investigated temporal variations in marine macrobenthic community structure from 1980 to 2003 in high-arctic Kongsfjorden (Svalbard) based on analysis of annual photographs at a permanent rocky bottom station. Abundance and area covered by macrobenthic organisms were estimated based on image analysis of high-resolution photographs, and community summary parameters were calculated as the basis for examination of interannual patterns. Interannual variability in abundance and species diversity were related to climate variability. 45{\%} of the variability of the benthic community in Kongsfjorden could be attributed to environmental factors linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) and its local manifestations. The temperature of the West Spitzbergen Current (WSC) was a link between the NAOI and the benthic community. Biodiversity was negatively correlated to the NAOI. Severe changes in the benthic community were observed between 1994 and 1996 coinciding with a shift of the NAOI from a positive to a negative mode. The increase in biodiversity during this period was accompanied by a decline of actinarians and the appearance of dense carpets of brown algae. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that nearshore oceanographic conditions can have important effects on the structure of benthic communities. On Santa Cruz Island (SCI), CA, USA there is a persistent difference in mean annual sea surface temperature (SST) around the island due to its location at the confluence of opposing cold and warm ocean current systems. Over the course of a 4-year study (1997–2001) seawater nutrient and chl-a concentrations, algal tissue C:N ratios, recruitment and growth of filter-feeders (barnacles and mussels), and intertidal community structure were measured at six intertidal sites around the island. There were strong associations between remotely sensed SST and patterns of community structure. Macrophyte abundance was highest at sites with persistently low SST, while recruitment, abundance, and growth of filter-feeding invertebrates were strongly, positively correlated with SST. The cold-water sites were associated with higher nutrient concentrations and lower algal C:N ratios, particularly in the winter months. Values of chl-a were generally low and variable among sites, and were not correlated with the predominant SST gradient. Recruitment of barnacles and mussels was positively correlated with adult abundance across all sites. While detailed experimental studies are needed to further evaluate the mechanisms underlying community dynamics, these results indicate that the confluence of cold- and warm-water masses around SCI may determine the contrasting patterns of intertidal community structure.},

abstract = {Documenting the scale of movement among populations is an important challenge for marine ecol- ogy. Using nine microsatellite markers, evidence of ge- netic structure in a marine kelp, the sea palm Postelsia palmaeformis Ruprecht, was examined in the vicinity of Cape Flattery, Washington state, USA (48? 24¢ N, 124?44¢ W). Genetic clustering analysis implemented without reference to geographic structure strongly sug- gested that a number of distinct genetic clusters existed among the 245 plants sampled in August in the years 1997–2001. Subsequent analysis showed that clustering was associated with geographically defined populations both among (km scale) and within (m scale) sampling sites. Fst analysis of geographically defined populations revealed significant genetic differentiation among pop- ulations of plants as little as 5 m apart, evidence of ge- netic structuring at even smaller scales, and a sharp increase in Fst across populations separated by up to 23 m. Fst values were also high and approximately unchanging (Fst=0.470) for populations separated by greater distances (up to 11 km), consistent with a sce- nario of rare dispersal by detached, floating plants car- ried by variable currents. The results corroborate natural history observations suggesting that P. palmae- formis has extremely short (1–3 m) spore dispersal dis- tances, and indicate that the dynamics of sea palm populations are more affected by local processes than recruitment from distant populations.

abstract = {The effect of human trampling on the abundance of small invertebrates inhabiting rocky shallow bottoms was studied at Asinara Island MPA. To this aim we have conducted two experiments. The first was a quantitative study and tested the hypothesis that small invertebrates are more abundant at no-entry locations than at the location visited by tourists through time (before, during and after tourist season). The second was a manipulative experiment and tested the hypothesis that the abundance of small invertebrates is indirectly related to experimental trampling intensities. The effect due to tourist visitation was not highlighted on overall assemblages, suggesting that present seasonal tourist load at the MPA does not cause a significantly negative effect on the zoobenthic community studied. Although tourists exhibited trampling activity at the visited location, none of taxa examined showed a significant lower abundance during and strictly after the end of seasonal tourism peak in the visited location, rather than at control locations. However, results obtained with the second experiment suggested that the effects of different experimental trampling intensities on small invertebrates were variable among taxa. The experimental trampling caused immediate declines in the density of tanaids, nematodes, acari, bivalves, gammarids, echinoderms, isopods, and harpacticoids. For some of these taxa a recovery in abundance was observed within one month. This kind of data may offer important information to estimate the number of visitors compatible with the sensitivity of zoobenthic assemblages, and may substantially contribute to appropriate MPA management. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract In South Africa, more than 7000 t (f wt) of kelp (Ecklonia maxima) fronds are harvested annually to feed cultured abalone. Carpoblepharis flaccida, Gelidium vittatum and Polysiphonia virgata are conspicuous red algal epiphytes on older kelps and provide habitat and food for numerous animals. Over 4.5 y, we examined the effects of one destructive harvest of E. maxima on these 3 epiphytes. Two 20 20 m plots of kelp with similar epiphyte loads were demarcated. In one, all E. maxima sporophytes with stipes longer than 50 cm were harvested. The other plot served as a control. After 2.5 y the biomass of E. maxima in the harvested plot had recovered to control levels, but the epiphyte load (g epiphytes. Kg kelp1) was statistically lower in the harvested plot after 2.5 and 3.5 y, and only recovered after 4.5 y. While most commercial harvesters cut through the ``heads'' (primary blades) of the kelp, effectively killing them, a new, non-lethal method removes secondary blades 20-30 cm from their bases, leaving the meristems and primary blades intact. At 5 sites studied, G. vittatum and P. virgata were found almost entirely on stipes and primary blades, and harvesting only distal parts of secondary blades limited losses to about 50{\%} of C. flaccida biomass. To protect epiphytes, non-lethal harvesting is recommended and permanent non-harvest zones have been established in addition to limiting kelp yields and disallowing harvesting in Marine Protected Areas.},

abstract = {A conceptual paradigm, the "Relative Dominance Model", provides the perspective to assess the interactive external forcing-mechanisms controlling phase shifts among the dominant benthic functional groups on tropical coral reefs [i.e., microalgal turfs and frondose macroalgae (often harmful) versus reef-building corals and calcareous coralline algae (mostly beneficial due to accretion of calcareous reef framework)]. Manipulative experiments, analyses of existing communities and bioassays tested hypotheses that the relative dominances of these functional groups are mediated by two principal controlling factors: nutrients (i.e., bottom-up control) and herbivory (i.e., top-down control). The results show that reduced nutrients alone do not preclude fleshy algal growth when herbivory is low, and high herbivory alone does not prevent fleshy algal growth when nutrients are elevated. However, reduced nutrients in combination with high herbivory virtually eliminate all forms of fleshy micro- and macro-algae. The findings reveal considerable complexity in that increases in bottom-up nutrient controls and their interactions stimulate harmful fleshy algal blooms (that can alter the abundance patterns among functional groups, even under intense herbivory); conversely, elevated nutrients inhibit the growth of ecologically beneficial reef-building corals. The results show even further complexity in that nutrients also act directly as either limiting factors (e.g., physiological stresses) or as stimulatory mechanisms (e.g., growth enhancing factors), as well as functioning indirectly by influencing competitive outcomes. Herbivory directly reduces fleshy-algal biomass, which indirectly (via competitive release) favors the expansion of grazer-resistant reef-building corals and coralline algae. Because of the sensitive nature of direct/indirect and stimulating/limiting interacting factors, coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic reversal effects that decrease top-down controls and, concomitantly, increase bottom-up controls, dramatically altering ecosystem resiliencies.},

abstract = {Two species of kelp are exploited commercially in South Africa. Use of beach-cast Laminaria pallida is limited, although it comprises the bulk of the biomass on the northern West Coast. Ecklonia maxima dominates the southern West Coast and provides most of the material for the South African kelp industry. Harvests of E. maxima fronds for abalone feed have reached 3 000{\^{a}}€“5 000 tonnes fresh weight (t f wt) y-1, whereas beachcast material of both species (about 1 000t dry wt y-1) is collected mainly for alginate extraction. For the first time, a South African kelp inventory has been compiled using all available data for the 900km-long West Coast (Cape Agulhas to the Orange River), although a few gaps remain. Beds of E. maxima and L. pallida reaching the surface at low spring tides were mapped using one or several methods: infrared aerial photography, digital multispectral aerial imagery, Landsat satellite imagery, and physical mapping with a hand-held GPS. The data are on a GIS database. Landsat 5 TM imagery could identify the presence of kelp beds, but only infrared aerial imagery and multispectral imaging at low spring tides accurately quantified surface areas of kelp beds. Biomass of the main kelp (E. maxima) is variable in space (between 3kg f wt m-2 and 24kg f wt m-2) and time (changes of up to 50{\%}), making estimates for management difficult. Using an average biomass value of 12kg m-2, the total biomass of surface-reaching kelp beds on the West Coast is estimated to exceed 593 000t f wt, but extensive subsurface beds remain unquantified. Results are discussed in relation to sustainable limits to harvesting, gaps in knowledge, and the improved management of kelp resources.},

Laboratory data available for marine fish and invertebrates from various climatic regions led to the hypothesis that, as a unifying principle, a mismatch between the demand for oxygen and the capacity of oxygen supply to tissues is the first mechanism to restrict whole-animal tolerance to thermal extremes. We show in the eelpout, Zoarces viviparus, a bioindicator fish species for environmental monitoring from North and Baltic Seas (Helcom), that thermally limited oxygen delivery closely matches environmental temperatures beyond which growth performance and abundance decrease. Decrements in aerobic performance in warming seas will thus be the first process to cause extinction or relocation to cooler waters.},

This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems, yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross-referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications.

Under conditions expected in the 21st century, global warming and ocean acidification will compromise carbonate accretion, with corals becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef-associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people. As the International Year of the Reef 2008 begins, scaled-up management intervention and decisive action on global emissions are required if the loss of coral-dominated ecosystems is to be avoided.},

abstract = {Beach-cast wrack is a prominent feature of beaches of south-western Australia. We examined the fauna of these beaches to explore the generalisation [Polis, G.A., Hurd, S.D., 1995. Extraordinarily high spider densities on islands: flow of energy from the marine to terrestrial food webs and the absence of predation. Ecology 92, 4382-4386] that beach-cast wrack from highly productive marine ecosystems subsidises low productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, to establish whether this generalisation is relevant to oligotrophic marine systems. We sampled three beaches with high and three beaches with low volumes of beach-cast wrack to determine if: (1) the presence of wrack influences the abundance of macroinvertebrates; (2) wrack acts as a food source for beach macroinvertebrates; and (3) the influence of wrack varies between zones above the high water mark. We measured wrack volume and composition, sediment characteristics, the abundance of different epibenthic and infaunal macroinvertebrates taxa, and $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates. The mean volume of wrack on high-wrack beaches was 0.27-1.07 m3wrack m-2compared to 0.00-0.09 m3wrack m-2on low-wrack beaches. There were no significant differences in sediment grain size, moisture content or loss on ignition between the two types of beaches or zones. Epibenthic fauna and infauna were consistently abundant on high-wrack beaches (20-291 and 0.5-3.5 individuals 0.64 m-2, respectively), but either absent or extremely rare in low-wrack beaches (0-3 and 0-0.1 individuals 0.64 m-2, respectively). Within high-wrack beaches, there were no significant differences in the abundance of epifauna or infauna among beaches or between zones. The $\delta$13C values of macroinvertebrates at all sites were most similar to red and brown algae, with the exception of beetles from two beaches, which were closest to seagrasses. Mixing model (Isosource) results for mesograzing amphipods and dipteran flies suggested carbon was assimilated mostly from the seagrass Posidonia spp., the dune grass Spinifex longifolia and red algae for amphipods and from brown algae, red algae and dune vegetation for dipteran flies. We conclude that the presence of marine-derived wrack plays a major role in subsidising production of macroinvertebrates on beaches of south-western Australia. We suggest that marine subsidies can play a role in supporting terrestrial production, even in oligotrophic marine environments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this article, a collaborative effort between archaeologists and marine ecologists, we discuss the role kelp forest ecosystems may have played in facilitating the movement of maritime peoples from Asia to the Americas near the end of the Pleistocene. Growing in cool nearshore waters along rocky coastlines, kelp forests offer some of the most productive habitats on earth, with high primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, and three-dimensional habitat supporting a diverse array of marine organisms. Today, extensive kelp forests are found around the North Pacific from Japan to Baja California. After a break in the tropics—where nearshore mangrove forests and coral reefs are highly productive—kelp forests are also found along the Andean Coast of South America. These Pacific Rim kelp forests support or shelter a wealth of shellfish, fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and seaweeds, resources heavily used historically by coastal peoples. By about 16,000 years ago, the North Pacific Coast offered a linear migration route, essentially unobstructed and entirely at sea level, from northeast Asia into the Americas. Recent reconstructions suggest that rising sea levels early in the postglacial created a highly convoluted and island-rich coast along Beringia's southern shore, conditions highly favorable to maritime hunter-gatherers. Along with the terrestrial resources available in adjacent landscapes, kelp forests and other nearshore habitats sheltered similar suites of food resources that required minimal adaptive adjustments for migrating coastal peoples. With reduced wave energy, holdfasts for boats, and productive fishing, these linear kelp forest ecosystems may have provided a kind of “kelp highway” for early maritime peoples colonizing the New World.},

abstract = {Over the centuries, land reclamation, coastal development, overfishing and pollution have nearly eliminated European wetlands, seagrass meadows, shellfish beds, biogenic reefs and other productive and diverse coastal habitats. It is estimated that every day between 1960 and 1995, a kilometre of European coastline was developed. Most countries have estimated losses of coastal wetlands and seagrasses exceeding 50{\%} of the original area with peaks above 80{\%} for many regions. Conspicuous declines, sometimes to virtual local disappearance of kelps and other complex macro- algae, have been observed in several countries. A few dominant threats have led to these losses over time. The greatest impacts to wetlands have consistently been land claim and coastal devel- opment. The greatest impacts to seagrasses and macroalgae are presently associated with degraded water quality while in the past there have been more effects from destructive fishing and diseases. Coastal development remains an important threat to seagrasses. For biogenic habitats, such as oyster reefs and maerls, some of the greatest impacts have been from destructive fishing and overexploi- tation with additional impacts of disease, particularly to native oysters. Coastal development and defence have had the greatest known impacts on soft-sediment habitats with a high likelihood that trawling has affected vast areas. The concept of ‘shifting baselines', which has been applied mostly to the inadequate historical perspective of fishery losses, is extremely relevant for habitat loss more generally. Most habitat loss estimates refer to a relatively short time span primarily within the last century. However, in some regions, most estuarine and near-shore coastal habitats were already severely degraded or driven to virtual extinction well before 1900. Native oyster reefs were ecologically extinct by the 1950s along most European coastlines and in many bays well before that. These shellfish reefs are among the most endangered coastal habitats, but they receive some of the least protection. Nowadays less than 15{\%} of the European coastline is considered in ‘good' condition. Those fragments of native habitats that remain are under continued threat, and their management is not generally informed by adequate knowledge of their distribution and status. There are many policies and directives aimed at reducing and reversing these losses but their overall positive benefits have been low. Further neglecting this long history of habitat loss and transfor- mation may ultimately compromise the successful management and future sustainability of those few fragments of native and semi-native coastal habitats that remain in Europe.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of vicariance events on the establishment of phylogeographic patterns in the marine environment is well documented, and generally accepted as an important cause of cladogenesis. Founder dispersal (i.e. long-distance dispersal followed by founder effect speciation) is also frequently invoked as a cause of genetic divergence among lineages, but its role has long been challenged by vicariance biogeographers. Founder dispersal is likely to be common in species that colonize remote habitats by means of rafting (e.g. seahorses), as long-distance dispersal events are likely to be rare and subsequent additional recruitment from the source habitat is unlikely. In the present study, the relative importance of vicariance and founder dispersal as causes of cladogenesis in a circumglobally distributed seahorse lineage was investigated using molecular dating. A phylogeny was reconstructed using sequence data from mitochondrial and nuclear markers, and the well-documented closure of the Central American seaway was used as a primary calibration point to test whether other bifurcations in the phylogeny could also have been the result of vicariance events. The feasibility of three other vicariance events was explored: a) the closure of the Indonesian Seaway, resulting in sister lineages associated with the Indian Ocean and West Pacific, respectively; b) the closure of the Tethyan Seaway, resulting in sister lineages associated with the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, respectively, and c) continental break-up during the Mesozoic followed by spreading of the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in pairs of lineages with amphi-Atlantic distribution patterns. RESULTS: Comparisons of pairwise genetic distances among the seahorse species hypothesized to have diverged as a result of the closure of the Central American Seaway with those of published teleost sequences having the same distribution patterns show that the seahorses were among the last to diverge. This suggests that their cladogenesis was associated with the final closure of this seaway. Although two other divergence events in the phylogeny could potentially have arisen as a result of the closures of the Indonesian and Tethyan seaways, respectively, the timing of the majority of bifurcations in the phylogeny differed significantly from the dates of vicariance events suggested in the literature. Moreover, several divergence events that resulted in the same distribution patterns of lineages at different positions in the phylogeny did not occur contemporaneously. For that reason, they cannot be the result of the same vicariance events, a result that is independent of molecular dating. CONCLUSION: Interpretations of the cladogenetic events in the seahorse phylogeny based purely on vicariance biogeographic hypotheses are problematic. We conclude that the evolution of the circumglobally distributed seahorse lineage was strongly influenced by founder dispersal, and suggest that this mode of speciation may be particularly important in marine organisms that lack a pelagic dispersal phase and instead disperse by means of rafting.},

abstract = {The creation of seagrass biomass maps by diving/snorkelling is time-consuming and expensive. This paper presents a method for estimating seagrass dry weight using a photo-library of classes of differing seagrass biomass. Field data were collected at seagrass beds in Ngederrak Reef, Palau, in 2006. Photos of 25 × 25 cm quadrats were taken prior to the collection the above-ground biomass for determination of biomass dry weight. Fifteen classes of seagrass biomass and substrate type were identified. The dry weight for each class of seagrass was measured in laboratory. A photo-library was created for biomass classification where each in situ quadrat photo is accompanied with seagrass dry weight of the sample and a photo of the sorted sample taken in laboratory. The photo-library of quadrats was then used to estimate seagrass biomass on photos gathered along 100 m long transects at 2 m intervals. This procedure was conducted by three different observers. The seagrass dry weight estimates were consistent between interpreters even if one of the interpreters had no experience in seagrass research. This approach allows quick collection of seagrass dry weight data over large areas. The method can be used for creating seagrass biomass maps by snorkelling/diving and/or for calibrating and validating biomass maps created by remote sensing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Macrocystis pyrifera (Giant Kelp) forests form important habitats in temperate coastal regions. Hydrodynamics control the transport of nutrients, food particles, larvae and spores at scales ranging from boundary layers around individual blades to entire kelp forests. Our measurements include vertical profiles of current and temperature, and concurrent wave measurements, at a number of different locations in and around a kelp forest at Santa Cruz, California. We find that flow at the site is dominated by variations at diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies. A vertically sheared across-shore flow, consistent with flow driven by an across-shore density gradient, is thought to be important for exchange between the kelp forest and the surrounding coastal ocean. Within the kelp forest, currents are reduced by a factor that correlates with surface canopy coverage, higher frequency internal waves are damped, and onshore transport due to waves (Stokes drift) is estimated to be similar in magnitude to that due to currents. Richardson numbers within the kelp forest are higher than those outside the kelp forest and indicate that the water column within the kelp forest is usually stable to turbulence generation by mean velocity shear.

abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {Herbivory on marine macroalgae (seaweeds) in temperate areas is often dominated by relatively small gastropods and crustaceans (mesoherbivores). The effects of these herbivores on the performance of adult seaweeds have so far been almost exclusively investigated under artificial laboratory conditions. Furthermore, several recent laboratory studies with mesoherbivores indicate that inducible chemical resistance may be as common in seaweeds as in vascular plants. However, in order to further explore and test the possible ecological significance of induced chemical resistance in temperate seaweeds, data are needed that address this issue in natural populations. We investigated the effect of grazing by littorinid herbivorous snails (Littorina spp.) on the individual net growth of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum in natural field populations. Furthermore, the capacity for induced resistance in the seaweeds was assessed by removing herbivores and assaying for relaxation of defences. We found that ambient densities of gastropod herbivores significantly reduced net growth by 45{\%} in natural field populations of A. nodosum. Seaweeds previously exposed to grazing in the field were less consumed by gastropod herbivores in feeding bioassays. Furthermore, the concentration of phlorotannins (polyphenolics), which have been shown to deter gastropod herbivores, was higher in the seaweeds that were exposed to gastropod herbivores in the field. This field study corroborates earlier laboratory experiments and demonstrates that it is important to make sure that the lack of experimental field data on marine mesoherbivory does not lead to rash conclusions about the lack of significant effects of these herbivores on seaweed performance. The results strongly suggest that gastropods exert a significant selection pressure on the evolution of defensive traits in the seaweeds, and that brown seaweeds can respond to attacks by natural densities of these herbivores through increased chemical resistance to further grazing.},

Relation- ships between patterns in settlement and indices of the temperature regime, such as average weekly temperature, temperature fluctuations, water column stratification and thermal history (growing degree-day) were determined using multiple linear regressions. Although settler abundance varied interannually, it was highest in early autumn, and was generally higher at depth (12 and 8 m) than in the shallows (4 m). Abundance was an order of magnitude greater after a significantly warmer win- ter. Growing degree-day accounted for up to 81{\%} of the variability in settler abundance, whereas average temperature, temperature fluctuations and stratification were less important. The strong positive relationship between thermal history and settlement of this ecologically important species suggests that abundance of established introduced marine species may increase with the increased temperatures predicted to result from climate change},

abstract = {Recent work on European (Swedish and English) populations of Ascophyllum nodosum has detected inducible defenses in response to snail grazing that include a decrease in algal palatability and an increase in phlorotannin concentration, a class of potential chemical defenses. However, tests of induced responses in other A. nodosum populations are lacking and we thus have a limited understanding of how widespread such responses are in fucoid algae. We exposed a North American (Massachusetts) A. nodosum population to Littorina obtusata, the same snail species used in previous studies, and tested for the presence of inducible responses during 2 experiments. In contrast to European populations, the North American population of A. nodosum did not develop any such responses. Exposure to either direct grazing or just waterborne cues associated with grazing for 26 d failed to suppress the palatability of artificial foods made from seaweed tissues exposed to these treatments. In addition, exposure to grazer cues did not increase seaweed phlorotannin levels compared to controls. The lack of induced responses in the North American population cannot be attributed to tissue type or potential seasonal variation in inducibility because each of our 2 independent experiments tested for responses in 2 tissue types (apical tips and basal shoots) in both the winter and spring. Furthermore, consistent with European work, the North American population lacked obvious grazing damage at the time of collection, suggesting that the differences we observed were unrelated to recent history with grazers. Thus, our work and that of others indicates that A. nodosum displays considerable inter-population variability in its response to a single herbivore species.},

abstract = {Abstract Climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation play an important role in controlling local and regional scale differences in population dynamics and species distributions, and large-scale climatic events such as El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) have been shown to affect population dynamics of key species in many ecosystems, particularly in kelp forests. Few studies have been able to evaluate the consequences of climate variables on the structure and dynamics of biological communities, in large part because the lack of data at appropriate spatial and temporal scales has made it difficult to adequately address local-scale responses of species and communities to such events over relevant time scales. Here, we combined an unprecedented dataset of kelp forest species' abundances from the Channel Islands, California with data for several local, regional, and global scale climatic variables to evaluate the temporal and spatial scale at which one can detect community-wide effects of climate variables, in particular ENSO events. We found large and significant local-scale differences in community structure, but these differences were not related to differences in climatic variables. Moreover, giant kelp abundance, which has been shown to be highly sensitive to water temperature and storm disturbance, was a poor predictor of community differences, and all communities tended to decline in abundance over the 20-year sampling period, suggesting a press perturbation to the system such as PDO cycles or sustained fishing pressure. Although ENSO events can have dramatic impacts on the abundance and distribution of giant kelp itself across the range of the species, such events appear to have little effect on local-scale kelp forest community structure or dynamics.},

abstract = {Two species of kelp are exploited commercially in South Africa. Use of beach-cast Laminaria pallida is limited, although it comprises the bulk of the biomass on the northern West Coast. Ecklonia maxima dominates the southern West Coast and provides most of the material for the South African kelp industry. Harvests of E. maxima fronds for abalone feed have reached 3 000{\^{a}}€“5 000 tonnes fresh weight (t f wt) y-1, whereas beachcast material of both species (about 1 000t dry wt y-1) is collected mainly for alginate extraction. For the first time, a South African kelp inventory has been compiled using all available data for the 900km-long West Coast (Cape Agulhas to the Orange River), although a few gaps remain. Beds of E. maxima and L. pallida reaching the surface at low spring tides were mapped using one or several methods: infrared aerial photography, digital multispectral aerial imagery, Landsat satellite imagery, and physical mapping with a hand-held GPS. The data are on a GIS database. Landsat 5 TM imagery could identify the presence of kelp beds, but only infrared aerial imagery and multispectral imaging at low spring tides accurately quantified surface areas of kelp beds. Biomass of the main kelp (E. maxima) is variable in space (between 3kg f wt m-2 and 24kg f wt m-2) and time (changes of up to 50{\%}), making estimates for management difficult. Using an average biomass value of 12kg m-2, the total biomass of surface-reaching kelp beds on the West Coast is estimated to exceed 593 000t f wt, but extensive subsurface beds remain unquantified. Results are discussed in relation to sustainable limits to harvesting, gaps in knowledge, and the improved management of kelp resources.},

abstract = {Abstract Polar seaweeds are strongly adapted to the low temperatures of their environment, Antarctic species more strongly than Arctic species due to the longer cold water history of the Antarctic region. By reason of the strong isolation of the Southern Ocean the Antarctic marine flora is characterized by a high degree of endemism, whereas in the Arctic only few endemic species have been found so far. All polar species are strongly shade adapted and their phenology is finely tuned to the strong seasonal changes of the light conditions. The paper summarises the present knowledge of seaweeds from both polar regions with regard to the following topics: the history of seaweed research in polar regions; the environment of seaweeds in polar waters; biodiversity, biogeographical relationships and vertical distribution of Arctic and Antarctic seaweeds; life histories and physiological thallus anatomy; temperature demands and geographical distribution; light demands and depth zonation; the effect of salinity, temperature and desiccation on supra-and eulittoral seaweeds; seasonality of reproduction and the physiological characteristics of microscopic developmental stages; seasonal growth and photosynthesis; elemental and nutritional contents and chemical and physical defences against herbivory. We present evidence to show that specific characteristics and adaptations in polar seaweeds help to explain their ecological success under environmentally extreme conditions. In conclusion, as a perspective and guide for future research we draw attention to many remaining gaps in knowledge.},

These paradigms hinge on the notion that tropical surface waters are too warm and nutrient-depleted to support kelp productivity and survival. We present a synthetic oceanographic and ecophysiological model that accurately identifies all known kelp populations and, by using the same criteria, predicts the existence of {\textgreater}23,500 km(2) unexplored submerged (30- to 200-m depth) tropical kelp habitats. Predicted tropical kelp habitats were most probable in regions where bathymetry and upwelling resulted in mixed-layer shoaling above the depth of minimum annual irradiance dose for kelp survival. Using model predictions, we discovered extensive new deep-water Eisenia galapagensis populations in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos that increased in abundance with increasing depth to {\textgreater}60 m, complete with cold-water flora and fauna of temperate affinities. The predictability of deep-water kelp habitat and the discovery of expansive deep-water Gal{\'{a}}pagos kelp forests validate the extent of deep-water tropical kelp refugia, with potential implications for regional productivity and biodiversity, tropical food web ecology, and understanding of the resilience of tropical marine systems to climate change.},

abstract = {Ocean waves impose large hydrodynamic forces on organisms living on rocky shores. Many intertidal organisms are structurally flexible, and the effect of this flexibility on the mechanical forces they experience is poorly understood. In addition, organisms in the rocky intertidal zone are generally much smaller than those in subtidal or terrestrial habitats. This study examined the influence of structural flexibility on the forces imposed by waves on the intertidal seaweed Pelvetiopsis limitata, including the potential for a mechanical size constraint on this species. A mechanical model of a seaweed on a wave-swept shore was developed on the basis of laboratory measurements of algal characteristics. Computer simulations predict that flexibility dramatically increases the forces imposed on the algae, particularly for large individuals. Along with field data on wave conditions and algal tenacity, this indicates that large algae are more likely to be dislodged than small ones throughout the year, and that very large individuals are expected to survive only during the summer and early fall. Measurements of thallus size in a population of P. limitata during a 2 yr period corroborated these model predictions. Algae in the field developed reproductive structures during the summer and early fall, when they were the largest and waves were the smallest. Thus, P. limitata exhibits a life-history strategy in which it grows large when seasonal wave conditions permit, and reproduces before becoming dislodged by large winter waves, mitigating the reproductive consequences of a mechanical size constraint. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

The epiphytic algae associated with the stipe of Laminaria hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie are important as habitat and food source for numerous faunal species along the Norwegian coastline. My investigations were performed on samples taken from kelp stipes in the area of Finn{\o}y, mid-Norway, in April, June, September and November 2005. I address questions of how the epiphytic community structure and primary production relates to a gradient of wave exposure, and the seasonal aspects of these relationships were also brought into the analyses. Both univariate and multivariate statistical methods were used in this approach. The amount of biomass found on a stipe was first of all related to the length of the stipe, and stipe lengths increased with increasing levels of wave exposure. A definite peak in total biomass was found in September. The species composition of epiphytes on the kelp stipes showed variation with increasing exposure. However, the variation within sites with the same index of exposure was also very high, suggesting that differences on a smaller scale may be of great importance. Differences in the species composition between sampling periods were also found. I conclude that both epiphyte species composition and productivity in kelp forest areas are affected by wave exposure, or some factors related to wave exposure, and that the structures of these epiphytic communities change through the season},

abstract = {Kelp may be useful as a bioindicator because they are primary producers that are eaten by higher trophic level organisms, including people and livestock. Often when kelp or other algae species are used as bioindicators, the whole organism is homogenized. However, some kelp can be over 25 m long from their holdfast to the tip of the blade, making it important to understand how contaminant levels vary throughout the plant. We compared the levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury and selenium in five different parts of the kelp Alaria nana to examine the variability of metal distribution. To be useful as a bioindicator, it is critical to know whether levels are constant throughout the kelp, or which part is the highest accumulator. Kelp were collected on Adak Island in the Aleutian Chain of Alaska from the Adak Harbor and Clam Cove, which opens onto the Bering Sea. In addition to determining if the levels differ in different parts of the kelp, we wanted to determine whether there were locational or size-related differences. Regression models indicated that between 14{\%} and 43{\%} of the variation in the levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, manganese, mercury, and selenium was explained by total length, part of the plant, and location (but not for lead). The main contributors to variability were length (for arsenic and selenium), location (mercury), and part of the plant (for arsenic, cadmium, chromium and manganese). The higher levels of selenium occurred at Clam Cove, while mercury was higher at the harbor. Where there was a significant difference among parts, the holdfast had the highest levels, although the differences were not great. These data indicate that consistency should be applied in selecting the part of kelp (and the length) to be used as a bioindicator. While any part of Alaria could be collected for some metals, for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and manganese a conversion should be made among parts. In the Aleutians the holdfast can be perennial while the blade, whipped to pieces by winter wave action, is regrown each year. Thus the holdfast may be used for longer-term exposure for arsenic, cadmium, chromium and manganese, while the blade can be used for short-term exposure for all metals. Cadmium, lead and selenium were at levels that suggest that predators, including people, may be at risk from consuming Alaria. More attention should be devoted to heavy metal levels in kelp and other algae from Adak, particularly where they may play a role in a subsistence diets.},

abstract = {Environmental factors have long been shown to influence species distributions, with range limits often resulting from environmental stressors exceeding organism tolerances. However, these abiotic factors may differentially affect species with multiple life-history stages. Between September 2004 and January 2006, the roles of temperature and nutrient availability in explaining the southern distributions of two understory kelps, Pterygophora californica and Eisenia arborea (Phaeophyceae, Laminariales), were investigated along the coast of California, USA and the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, by limiting either: (a) tissue nitrogen uptake and storage by adult sporophytes during periods of elevated temperature, and/or (b) production of embryonic sporophytes by microscopic gametophytes. Results suggest that while adult sporophytes of both species are tolerant of high temperatures and low nutrients, reproduction by their microscopic stages is not. Specifically, while E. arborea produced embryonic sporophytes at both 12 and 18 degrees C, temperatures commonly observed throughout the southern portion of its range, P. californica produced sporophytes at 12 but not at 18 degrees C. As a result, it appears that the southern distribution of P. californica, which ends in northern Baja California, Mexico, may be limited by temperature acting on its microscopic stages. In contrast, the ability of E. arborea's microscopic and adult stages to tolerate elevated temperatures allows it to persist in the warmer southern waters of Baja California, as well as to the north along the California coast where both species co-occur.},

Morphological plasticity has been previously observed in the brown alga Padina jamaicensis, which displays a foliose morphology under low grazing pressure and a turf morphology in habitats with medium to high herbivory levels. To determine whether a different species of Padina, P. boergesenii, exhibits morphological plasticity regulated by herbivory, we excluded macroherbivores from experimental plots containing P. boergesenii thalli on a rocky reef off Santa Marta in the Colombian Caribbean. The experiment used exclusion cages to test for effects of herbivores and was carried out in two contrasting oceanographic seasons: upwelling (low water temperature and high water transparency) and rainy (higher temperature and low water transparency). The morphology of P. boergesenii was significantly affected by herbivory but only during the upwelling season. ...},

abstract = {In this review the most recent contributions to the field of molecular ecology and biogeography of mangrove trees are considered. Emphasis is on the obtained information of the different molecular marker methods used in mangrove genetics and on the potential to infer biogeographical patterns. Isozymes on average showed low or even no polymorphism in mangrove trees similar as known in seagrasses. The outcrossing Avicennia seems to be the most variable mangrove tree for isozymes. Both low amounts of interpretable allozymes and difficulties in maintaining the enzyme activity have reduced the number of successful studies during the isozyme era. Dominant marker methods (RAPD, AFLP and ISSR) were successful to demonstrate differences in amplified DNA products at large-scale geographical distances within Avicennia species and to estimate species relationships. Hybrid testing seldom revealed hybridization among tree species. The most promising markers (microsatellites or SSR) were only recently developed and will continue to provide evidence in future studies. SSR loci in Avicennia seem to show relatively low levels of polymorphism, though clearly demonstrating that populations located at the edge of the species range can be even more depauperated. Populations located more central in their native range and situated along the same coastline such as reported in Rhizophora, are expected to be only weakly differentiated due to increased levels of gene flow. Haplotypic chloroplast variants (PCR-RFLP) or sequences revealed strong genetic structuring between populations of Avicennia, Kandelia and Ceriops from different biogeographical oceanic regions. Recent views on long-distance dispersal and on gene flow across oceans as well as along the same coastline are discussed. A comparative analysis on genetic variables across species and regions indicated general trends in the partitioning of genetic variation. A conceptual map with a worldwide overview of those regions where high levels of gene flow were reported and of other regions that were considered as effective barriers, is presented. As an aim to increase the number of reliable comparisons of genetic variables across species or regions and to increase the relevance of mangrove genetics for local conservation issues, recommendations on the molecular markers and on the sampling design of individuals and populations are given within a conceptual context of evolutionary significant units. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Instead it is proposed here that Darwinism provides a general, metatheoretical framework for dealing with complex evolving systems, consisting of populations of varied and replicating entities, which are found in both nature and human society. There is no alternative to the core Darwinian principles of variation, selection and inheritance to explain the evolution of such systems. Neither the actual existence of human intentionality, nor the hypothetical existence of Lamarckian processes of acquired character inheritance, offer a barrier to the use of Darwinian explanations. However, while Darwinian principles are always necessary to explain complex evolving population systems, they are never sufficient on their own. Such a generalized Darwinism can accommodate several different stances found in the literature on bioeconomics and elsewhere.},

abstract = {There is concern about historical and continuing loss of canopy-forming algae across the world's temperate coastline. In South Australia, the sparse cover of canopy-forming algae on the Adelaide metropolitan coast has been of public concern with continuous years of anecdotal evidence culminating in 2 competing views. One view considers that current patterns existed before the onset of urbanisation, whereas the alternate view is that they developed after urbanisation. We tested hypothe- ses to distinguish between these 2 models, each centred on the reconstruction of historical covers of canopies on the metropolitan coast. Historically, the metropolitan sites were indistinguishable from con- temporary populations of reference sites across 70 km (i.e. Gulf St. Vincent), and could also represent a random subset of exposed coastal sites across 2100 km of the greater biogeographic province. Thus there was nothing ‘special' about the metropolitan sites historically, but today they stand out because they have sparser covers of canopies compared to equivalent locations and times in the gulf and the greater province. This is evidence of wholesale loss of canopy-forming algae (up to 70{\%}) on parts of the Adelaide metropolitan coast since major urbanisation. These findings not only set a research agenda based on the magnitude of loss, but they also bring into question the logic that smaller metropolitan populations of humans create impacts that are trivial relative to that of larger metropolitan centres. Instead, we highlight a need to recognise the ecological context that makes some coastal systems more vulnerable or resistant to increasing human-domination of the world's coastlines. We discuss challenges to this kind of research that receive little ecological discussion, particularly better leadership and administration, recognising that the systems we study out-live the life spans of individual research groups and operate on spatial scales that exceed the capacity of single research providers.

Neutral genetic variation among individuals or direct estimates of current gene flow are statistically related to landscape characteristics such as the presence of hypothesized barriers or the least-cost distance for an organism to move from one habitat patch to another, given the nature of the intervening matrix or habitat types. In the context of global change, a major challenge for landscape genetics is to address the spread of adaptive variation across landscapes. Genome scans combined with genetic sample collection along environmental gradients or in different habitat types attempt to identify molecular markers that are statistically related to specific environmental conditions, indicating adaptive genetic variation. The landscape genetics of adaptive variation may also help answer fundamental questions about the collective evolution of populations.},

abstract = {Dramatic shifts in community composition occur between vertical and horizontal rocky surfaces in subtidal environments worldwide, yet the forces mediating this transition are poorly understood. Vertical rock walls are often covered by lush, diverse communities of sessile suspension-feeding invertebrates, while adjacent horizontal substrates are dominated by algae, or corals in the tropics. Multiple factors, including light, sedimentation, water flow, and predation have been proposed to explain this pattern, but experimental tests of these hypotheses are lacking. We manipulated light level and predation to test whether variation in these mechanisms could be responsible for the shift in composition of sessile communities between vertical and horizontal surfaces in the rocky subtidal Gulf of Maine. Shaded horizontally oriented granite plots were dominated by invertebrates (e.g., ascidians, barnacles, bryozoans) after 25 months. Unshaded plots were dominated by macroalgae, which was virtually absent in shaded plots. Exclusion of grazers with cages had no effect on percent cover of invertebrates or algae. Preferential settlement of invertebrate larvae to shaded plots, due to larval behaviors such as negative phototaxis, did not seem to play a role. Shading likely affects post-settlement mortality of invertebrates by alleviating competition for space with algae, although greater abundance of micropredators in algal- dominated communities could also be important. Communities on shaded plots lacked many taxa present on natural wall communities, likely due to greater disturbance on horizontal substrates and/or lack of sufficient time for colonization of these taxa. These results suggest that light plays a key role in controlling the structure, composition, and function of shallow subtidal communities.},

abstract = {Structurally complex habitats are becoming rarer across temperate marine environments; indeed the coastal and marine world is getting flatter. In some cases marine habitats are lost entirely (e.g., wetlands are filled), but in many cases the loss is a gradual transition from a more complex to a less complex habitat (i.e., a change from canopy-forming to turf forming algae). We explore the multiple ways habitat loss affects marine species diversity, and propose a conceptual model that identifies the main interactions and feedbacks between these processes. The loss of habitat structure generally leads to lower abundances (biomasses) and often to declines in species richness. There is often also a suite of colonizing species that prosper from these transitions. These sets of expanding species can amplify the changes to the system, cause variable effects on species richness and other components of diversity, feed back to affect the various components of habitat loss (e.g. maintain new environmental conditions) and prevent the recovery of the system. Less well studied are the effects on between-habitat ($\beta$) diversity and functional diversity. We argue that we need to understand these latter changes to better manage and conserve the structure and function of ecosystems and the diverse services that humans continue to expect from them. Calling for more of the approaches and thinking that John Gray championed we discuss how this work can focus efforts in research, conservation, restoration and management. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding temporal variation at the scale of weeks to months is critical to understanding broad temporal patterns in diversity in the same way as understanding diversity across landscapes relies on understanding variation at the scale of meters. However, whereas small-scale spatial variation in temperate reef algal assemblages has been extensively studied, fine-scale temporal changes have not been well addressed. By sampling the macroalgae of a subtidal reef near Perth (Australia), dominated by the small kelp Ecklonia radiata, every 40 days over a 2-year period, we were able to test whether temporal changes in species richness, assemblage structure and species turn-over were related to seasonal changes in surface temperature, solar radiation and wave height. A total of 93 macroalgal taxa were identified, and species richness per sampling time ranged from 25 to 64 taxa 1.25 m-2. Biomass of E. radiata was positively correlated with changes in sea surface temperature and light, and negatively correlated with wave height. Species richness, assemblage structure and turn-over of other macroalgae were more associated with seasonal changes in kelp biomass than environmental variables per se. We conclude that seasonal changes in environmental conditions drive changes in the kelp canopy, which in turn drive changes in species richness and assemblage structure. This suggests that habitat-formers such as kelps can exert a strong temporal influence on associated communities, analogous to well-described spatial influences. Thus, as kelp canopy biomass expands and retracts over time-scales of weeks to months, so does available space for colonization and growth, resulting in a high species turn-over. Species richness is therefore increased and maintained through time, in the same way as canopy-gap mosaics increase and maintain species richness across spatial landscapes. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Short-term temporal dynamics of algal species in a subtidal kelp bed in relation to changes in environmental conditions and canopy biomass - Wernberg, T; Goldberg, N)

Maintenance of high diversity of macroalgae in many temperate rocky reef communities relies on biotic and abiotic factors and processes that vary spatially and temporally. In multi-layered assemblages dominated by canopy algae, spatial variation in diversity varies on the order of meters to tens of meters, and these patterns are commonly attributed to interactions between canopy layers and wave disturbance.

Canopy layers influence recruitment, survival and physiological of other algal species, through direct or indirect modification of the local environment. Wave removal causes canopy removal, and therefore maintains a mosaic of gaps and canopy-dominated patches. 
Species richness and diveristy of algae is usually lower under canopies, than in gaps.

Temporal changes in subtidal algal assemblages have been associated with seasonal patterns in light, temperature, water motion, and nutrient enrichment via upwelling and ocean circulation patterns (Breda and Foster, 1985; Nu´nez-Lo´pez and Casas Valdez, 1998; Diaz-Pullido and Garzon-Ferreira, 2002).

Temporal dynamics in algal species richness, assemblage structure and species turnover at Marmion was a function of a complex interplay between environmental change and the in- 
fluence of the dominant kelp, Ecklonia radiata. Kelp biomass was directly correlated with environmental variation, whereas species richness of algae was associated with temporal changes in kelp biomass. Seasonal change in biomass of E. radiata, was correlated with all of the environmental data, particularly temperature. 

The seasonal increase in kelp canopy biomass may be attributed to longer days and increased light levels. The negative correlation of wave height on canopy biomass suggests a thinning of kelp canopy mechanism (Thomsen et al 2004) 
We conclude that, over the course of a year, there was large variation in kelp biomass as well as species richness and assemblage structure of reef macroalgae. Seasonal changes in envi- 
ronmental conditions drove changes in the kelp canopy, which in turn influenced changes in species richness and assem- 
blage structure. Habitat-forming species such as kelps can exert a strong temporal influence on associated communities, which in many ways resembles well-described spatial influences. Thus, as kelp canopy biomass expands and retracts over 
time-scales of weeks to months, so does available space for colonization and growth, resulting in a high species turn-over. High species richness is therefore maintained over time, in the 
same way as canopy-gap mosaic increase and maintain species richness across spatial landscapes.},

abstract = {Many species of macroalgae have flat, strap-like blades in habitats exposed to rapidly flowing water, but have wide, ruffled "undulate" blades at protected sites. We used the giant bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, to investigate how these ecomorphological differences are produced. The undulate blades of N. luetkeana from sites with low flow remain spread out and flutter erratically in moving water, thereby not only enhancing interception of light, but also increasing drag. In contrast, strap-like blades of kelp from habitats with rapid flow collapse into streamlined bundles and flutter at low amplitude in flowing water, thus reducing both drag and interception of light. Transplant experiments in the field revealed that shape of the blade in N. luetkeana is a plastic trait. Laboratory experiments in which growing blades from different sites were subjected to tensile forces that mimicked the hydrodynamic drag experienced by blades in different flow regimes showed that change in shape is induced by mechanical stress. During growth experiments in the field and laboratory, we mapped the spatial distribution of growth in both undulate and strap-like blades to determine how these different morphologies were produced. The highest growth rates occur near the proximal ends of N. luetkeana blades of both morphologies, but the rates of transverse growth of narrow, strap-like blades are lower than those of wide, undulate blades. If rates of longitudinal growth at the edges of a blade exceed the rate of longitudinal growth along the midline of the blade, ruffles along the edges of the blade are produced by elastic buckling. In contrast, flat blades are produced when rates of longitudinal growth are similar across the width of a blade. Because ruffles are the result of elastic buckling, a compliant undulate N. luetkeana blade can easily be pushed into different configurations (e.g., the wavelengths of the ruffles along the edges of the blade can change, and the whole blade can twist into left- and right-handed helicoidal shapes), which may enhance movements of the blade in flowing water that reduce self-shading and increase mass exchange along blade surfaces.},

abstract = {Aerial or overhead photography is a technique commonly used to measure spatiotemporal variability in surface canopy kelps. To evaluate potential biases in this technique, we used elevated (shore-based) oblique angle photography coupled with in situ measurements of currents and tides to sample 4 independent Nereocystis luetkeana beds at sites adjacent to San Juan Island (Washington State, USA) in 2004 and 2005. Data were collected at high frequency (every 10 min) to quantify the effects of tidal height and tidal currents on the amount of N. luetkeana visible at the surface. Effects of tidal height were highly significant in all 6 time series. Current significantly affected apparent bed size in 5 of the 6 time series, although the magnitude of the effect varied among sites. N. luetkeana beds decrease in apparent size as current velocity increases and as tidal level increases. Currents can fluctuate rapidly, changing by many 10s of cm s–1 over periods as short as 10 min, due in large part to interactions of tides with local topography and bathymetry close to shore, where kelp beds are typically found. As a result, currents can introduce significant variability to estimates of kelp population size collected by remote sensing techniques.},

abstract = {The decline of many coral reef ecosystems in recent decades surprised experienced managers and researchers. It shattered old paradigms that these diverse ecosystems are spatially uniform and temporally stable on the scale of millennia. We now see reefs as heterogeneous, fragile, globally stressed ecosystems structured by strong positive or negative feedback processes. We review the causes and consequences of reef decline and ask whether management practices are addressing the problem at appropriate scales. We conclude that both science and management are currently failing to address the comanagement of extractive activities and ecological processes that drive ecosystems (e.g. productivity and herbivory). Most reef conservation efforts are directed toward reserve implementation, but new approaches are needed to sustain ecosystem function in exploited areas. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The two models were compared in an analysis of the distribution of seabed substrate in the Stockholm archipelago.

abstract = {To determine the relative importance of different sources of nitrate to the annual nitrogen needs of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, we measured ambient nitrate concentrations at a kelp forest for 13 months and characterized nitrate delivery using water column thermal structure and flow data collected in the forest and at its offshore edge. The forest's monthly nitrate supply varied by a factor of 50, while measured net nitrogen acquisition varied only fivefold. Maximum net nitrogen acquisition rates for fronds in the forest interior were 0.18 mmol N g-1 month-1 during spring upwelling in 2005 and declined fourfold during autumn until upwelling resumed the following year. Modeled gross nitrogen uptake with consideration of Michaelis-Menten kinetics for nitrate and mass transfer limitation was higher than observed net acquisition except during the warm stratified summer and autumn months, when net acquisition exceeded modeled gross uptake. This shortfall indicates that the kelp forest received over half its nitrogen from sources other than nitrate such as ammonium from epibionts. Most of the nitrate in the forest was delivered as a result of upwelling-favorable winds and convection. Internal waves and local streams contributed {\textless}9{\%} of the nitrate delivered to the forest on an annual basis and 20{\%} during stratified periods. Kelp used less than 5{\%} of the nitrate supplied to the forest. Nitrate delivery to this modest sized kelp forest was roughly equivalent between alongshore (45{\%}) and cross-shore flows (55{\%}), which distinguishes it from large kelp forests in which cross-shore flows dominate exchange.},

abstract = {The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to meta- population dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection–diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory—an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50–150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island ‘stepping stones' are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connect- ing distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be priori- tized for marine conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Interactions between water motion, primary productivity, and herbivory are complex. Rates of grazing by fish on tropical coral reefs and by sea urchins on temperate rocky reefs are usually high, but can be low in areas of extreme water motion. Some herbivores can switch between mobile (grazing) and sedentary (drift-feeding) behaviours, and this can be influenced by water motion. We compared the relative consumption of the kelp Ecklonia radiata at rocky reefs in western Australia with different wave exposures (inshore versus offshore). No herbivory was recorded offshore, suggesting that wave exposure might inhibit herbivory, We also compared grazing by fish and sea urchins, and grazing versus drift-feeding pathways. Grazing by fish and sea urchins was low, except at one inshore reef where grazing by fish was intense. In contrast, drift-feeding by sea urchins was recorded at all inshore reefs, suggesting that this is a ubiquitous behaviour in the region. We measured productivity of E. radiata to determine if spatial patterns in rates of herbivory matched those of productivity. Productivity of E. radiata was higher on offshore reefs at one location. The observed difference in consumption between inshore and offshore reefs at both locations suggests that consumption is not limited by productivity, but by exposure. Further, the high productivity offshore combined with low rates of herbivory suggest that offshore reefs might be a source of kelp that subsidises other habitats.},

abstract = {Diatoms contribute to a substantial portion of primary production in the oceans and many lakes. Owing to their relatively heavy cell walls and high nutrient requirements, planktonic diatoms are expected to decrease with climate warming because of reduced nutrient redistribution and increasing sinking velocities. Using a historical dataset, this study shows that diatoms were able to maintain their biovolume with increasing stratification in Lake Tahoe over the last decades; however, the diatom community structure changed. Increased stratification and reduced nitrogen to phosphorus ratios selected for small-celled diatoms, particularly within the Cyclotella genus. An empirical model showed that a shift in phytoplankton species composition and cell size was consistent within different depth strata, indicating that altered nutrient concentrations were not responsible for the change. The increase in small-celled species was sufficient to decrease the average diatom size and thus sinking velocity, which strongly influences energy transfer through the food web and carbon cycling. Our results show that within the diverse group of diatoms, small-sized species with a high surface area to volume ratio were able to adapt to a decrease in mixing intensity, supporting the hypotheses that abiotic drivers affect the size structure of planktonic communities and that warmer climate favours small-sized diatom cells.},

As a critical review, this paper does not seek to be comprehensive, but it extracts key ideas and discusses key material to evaluate the current state of knowledge on SIDS and climate change. Illustrative examples and references, rather than a full listing, are used to support points. The main way forward suggested for the future is better integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to ensure that data and methods are based on local interests while acknowledging and integrating local and traditional knowledge with other forms of knowledge. Placing climate change into appropriate contexts is also important along with filling in prominent knowledge gaps, especially moving beyond the current focus on Caribbean and Pacific SIDS},

abstract = {Geographic Information tools (GI tools) have become an essential component of research in landscape ecology. In this article we review the use of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and GI tools in landscape ecology, with an emphasis on free and open source software (FOSS) projects. Specifically, we introduce the background and terms related to the free and open source software movement, then compare eight FOSS desktop GIS with proprietary GIS to analyse their utility for landscape ecology research. We also provide a summary of related landscape analysis FOSS applications, and extensions. Our results indicate that (i) all eight GIS provide the basic GIS functionality needed in landscape ecology, (ii) they all facilitate customisation, and (iii) they all provide good support via forums and email lists. Drawbacks that have been identified are related to the fact that most projects are relatively young. This currently affects the size of their user and developer communities, and their ability to include advanced spatial analysis functions and up-to-date documentation. However, we expect these drawbacks to be addressed over time, as systems mature. In general, we see great potential for the use of free and open source desktop GIS in landscape ecology research and advocate concentrated efforts by the landscape ecology community towards a common, customisable and free research platform. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The additional stresses imposed by climate change in the coming years will require extraordinary adaptation. We need to track the changing status of ecosystems, deepen our understanding of the biological underpinnings for ecosystem service delivery and develop new tools and techniques for maintaining and restoring resilient biological and social systems. We will be building on an ecosystem foundation that has been radically compromised during the past half century. Most rivers have been totally restructured, oceans have been severely altered and depleted, coral reefs are near the tipping point of disappearing as functional ecosystems, over half of the land surface is devoted to livestock and crop agriculture, with little consideration for the ecosystem services that are being lost as a consequence, some irrevocably so. We have already seen many regime shifts, or tipping points, due to human activity, even before the onset of measurable climate change impacts on ecosystems. Climate change, caused mainly by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, will disrupt our ecosystem base in new ways. Already we are seeing widespread signs of change. Species behaviors are altering and disrupting mutualisms of long standing. We are seeing extinctions within vulnerable habitats and conditions where migrations are necessary for survival but where often there are no pathways available for successful movement in the fragmented world of today. These challenges represent an extraordinary threat to society and a call for urgent attention by the scientific community. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Calanus glacialis is an ecologically important marine copepod found throughout the Arctic Ocean with limited distributions in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. We employed molecular techniques to determine the population genetic structuring of C. glacialis across the boundaries of these 3 oceans. Examination of the DNA sequence of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene identified 2 predominant haplotypes which defined the Arctic and North Pacific (Bering Sea) populations. Advection from the Bering Sea into the Arctic as far as the western Canada Basin was detected, but C. glacialis from the Bering Sea was absent in the majority of Arctic Ocean samples. This indicates that C. glacialis from the Bering Sea was not reproductively established in the Arctic Ocean. Genetic divergence of Arctic and Bering Sea populations may have occurred during their isolation in the course of the Pleistocene glaciations, or, more recently, from unidirectional advection due to the northward current regime through the Bering Strait. Climate warming will increase opportunities for southern organisms to become established in the Arctic Ocean. The study of intraspecific genetic variation of C. glacialis has great potential in aiding the early detection of such ecological change.},

abstract = {Aim To study the siting of marine protected areas (MPAs) with respect to the biogeographical distribution of seaweeds within the Agulhas Marine Province and to assess the effectiveness of current MPAs in including (conserving) seaweeds of the South African south coast. Location South Africa – the south coast between Cape Agulhas and the Eastern Cape/Kwazulu-Natal border, and eight MPAs within that area. Methods We used interpolated seaweed distribution records from all available sources, in 50-km coastal sections. Cluster analysis (Jaccard Average Linkage) of species presence/absence data provided measures of similarity between coastal sections and between MPAs. Complementarity analyses identified the sequence of ‘importance' of sections/MPAs for conserving seaweed species. Results Species presence/absence data indicated two main groups, representing western (cooler water) and eastern (warmer water) biogeographical divisions, as well as several biogeographical subdivisions within each of these groups. Complementarity analysis yielded a sequence of ‘importance' of coastal sections (in terms of the highest number of species included) that began with a section just east of central in the Agulhas Marine Province, around Port Alfred, where there is no MPA. This was followed by the easternmost section (warmest water), which contains the Pondoland MPA, and then by the westernmost (coolest water) section, containing the De Hoop MPA. Similar analysis of the actual species collected in MPAs showed a generally similar pattern. Main conclusions Seven current MPAs and one proposed coastal MPA in the Agulhas Marine Province appear to be well distributed and well sited to include (conserve) the full biogeographical range of seaweeds. However, if further MPAs are to be considered, the Port Alfred area is recommended for improved conservation. This study did not examine estuaries, which may require improved conservation efforts. Seaweed distribution data, which are often relatively complete, offer a good tool for planning the siting of coastal MPAs.},

To estimate prospective distri- butional shifts in cold-water key structural seaweeds from both hemispheres, we related temperature require- ments and recent distributions of seaweeds to observed mean sea surface temperature (SST) isotherms for the periods 1980–1999 (Meteorological Office Hadley Cen- tre's SST data set; HadISST) and to modelled tempera- tures for 2080–2099 wCoupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) database prepared for the Intergovern- mental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) reportx based on moderate green- house gas emissions Special Report on Emission Sce- narios – Scenario B1 (SRESA1B). Under this scenario, North Atlantic polar to cold-temperate seaweeds inves- tigated will extend their distribution into the High Arctic until the end of the 21st century, but retreat along the northeastern Atlantic coastline. In contrast, selected Ant- arctic seaweeds will probably not significantly alter their latitudinal distributions, as deduced from our presently incomplete knowledge of their temperature requirements. We identified several cold-temperate regions where sea- weed composition and abundance will certainly change with elevated temperatures. The results are discussed in the context of local temperature conditions, effects of multifactorial abiotic and biotic interactions and expected ecological consequences for seaweed-dominated eco- systems.},

Species-specific responses to the combined effect of light and temperature stress showed sensitivity in the order S. latissima{\textgreater}L. digitata{\textgreater}A. esculenta. The optimum temperature range for photosynthesis in different Arctic kelp species' zoospores was between 7-13 degrees C, temperatures higher than in the natural environment. Short-term response to increasing temperature was non-lethal while moderate temperature increase had an ameliorating effect on the overall biological effect of UVR; where the lowest photoinhibition was observed at 13 degrees C under PAB and higher photosynthetic recovery was observed in UVR-pre-exposed zoospores at 7-13 degrees C compared to 2 degrees C. Above the temperature optima, continued cultivation under high temperature had a negative impact on the recovery of photoinhibition. The higher capacity for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) in A. esculenta and L. digitata helped to regulate and protect photosynthesis under light and temperature stress compared to S. latissima. The investigated Arctic kelp species may be able to locally survive under the influence of UVR at a certain range of temperature increase but the southernmost distribution range of the species may shift to higher latitudes; although natural selection may result in genotypes adapted to stressful environment.},

At each site, Macrocystis spp. was main- tained individually at three different water tempera- tures (ambient, ambient ) 4?C, ambient + 4?C) and in the presence or absence of the amphipod grazer Peramphithoe femorata for 14 d. High water tempera- tures ({\textgreater}20?C) provoked rapid degradation of Macrocystis spp. rafts. At moderate temperatures (15?C–20?C), algal survival depended on the presence of associated grazers.

abstract = {The kelp species Laminaria hyperborea constitutes highly productive kelp forest systems hosting a broad diversity of species and providing the basis for commercial kelp harvesting and, through its productivity, the fishing industry. Spatial planning and management of this important habitat and resource needs to be based on distribution maps and detailed knowledge of the main factors influencing the distribution. However, in countries with a long and complex coastline, such as Norway, detailed mapping is practically and economically difficult. Consequently, alternative methods are required. Based on modelled and field-measured geophysical variables and presence/absence data of L. hyperborea, a spatial predictive probability model for kelp distribution is developed. The influence of depth, slope, terrain curvature, light exposure, wave exposure, and current speed on the distribution of L. hyperborea are modelled using a generalized additive model. Using the Akaike Information Criterion, we found that the most important geophysical factors explaining the distribution of kelp were depth, terrain curvature, and wave and light exposure. The resulting predictive model was very reliable, showing good ability to predict the presence and absence of kelp.},

abstract = {The risks to human populations in coastal areas are changing due to climate and socio-economic changes, and these trends are predicted to accelerate during the twenty-first century. To understand these changing risks, and the resulting choices and pathways to successful management and adaptation, broad-scale integrated assessment is essential. Due to their complexity the two risks of flooding and erosion are usually managed independently, yet frequently they are interconnected by longshore exchange of sediments and the resulting broad scale morphological system behaviour. In order to generate new insights into the effects of climate change and coastal management practises on coastal erosion and flood risk, we present an integrated assessment of 72 km of shoreline over the twenty-first century on the East Anglian coast of England which is a site of significant controversy about how to manage coastal flood and erosion risks over the twenty-first century. A coupled system of hydrodynamic, morphological, reliability and socio-economic models has been developed for the analysis, implemented under scenarios of coastal management, climate and socio-economic change. The study is unique in coastal management terms because of the large spatial scale and extended temporal scale over which the analysis is quantified. This study for the first time quantifies what has for some years been argued qualitatively: the role of sediments released from cliff erosion in protecting neighbouring low-lying land from flooding. The losses and benefits are expressed using the common currency of economic risk. The analysis demonstrates that over the twenty-first century, flood risk in the study area is expected to be an order of magnitude greater than erosion risk. Climate and socio-economic change and coastal management policy have a significant influence on flood risk. This study demonstrates that the choices concerning coastal management are profound, and there are clear tradeoffs between erosion and flood impacts.},

abstract = {We tested the ability of sporophytes of a small kelp, Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, to adjust their photosynthesis, respiration, and cellular processes to increasingly warm ocean climates along a latitudinal gradient in ocean temperature (∼4°C). Tissue concentrations of pigment and nutrients decreased with increasing ocean temperature. Concurrently, a number of gradual changes in the metabolic balance of E. radiata took place along the latitudinal gradient. Warm-acclimatized kelps had 50{\%} lower photosynthetic rates and 90{\%} lower respiration rates at the optimum temperature than did cool-acclimatized kelps. A reduction in temperature sensitivity was also observed as a reduction in Q10-values from cool- to warm-acclimatized kelps for gross photosynthesis (Q10: 3.35 to 1.45) and respiration (Q10: 3.82 to 1.65). Respiration rates were more sensitive to increasing experimental temperatures (10{\%} higher Q10-values) than photosynthesis and had a higher optimum temperature, irrespective of sampling location. To maintain a positive carbon balance, E. radiata increased the critical light demand (Ec) exponentially with increasing experimental temperature. The temperature dependency of Ec was, however, weakened with increasing ocean temperature, such that the critical light demand was relaxed in kelp acclimated to higher ocean temperatures. Nevertheless, calculations of critical depth limits suggested that direct effects of future temperature increases are unlikely to be as strong as effects of reduced water clarity, another globally increasing problem in coastal areas.},

abstract = {I present dispersal distances for 44 species with data on propagule duration (PD) for 40 of these. Data were combined with those in Shanks et al. (2003; Ecol. Appl. 13: S159-S169), providing information on 67 species. PD and dispersal distance are correlated, but with many exceptions. The distribution of dispersal distances was bimodal. Many species with PDs longer than 1 day dispersed less than 1 km, while others dispersed tens to hundreds of kilometers. Organisms with short dispersal distances were pelagic briefly or remained close to the bottom while pelagic. Null models of passively dispersing propagules adequately predict dispersal distance for organisms with short PDs ({\textless}1 day), but overestimate dispersal distances for those with longer PDs. These models predict that propagules are transported tens of kilometers offshore; however, many types remain within the coastal boundary layer where currents are slower and more variable, leading to lower than predicted dispersal. At short PDs, dispersal distances estimated from genetic data are similar to observed. At long PDs, genetic data generally overestimate dispersal distance. This discrepancy is probably due to the effect of rare individuals that disperse long distances, thus smoothing genetic differences between populations. Larval behavior and species' life-history traits can play a critical role in determining dispersal distance.},

The produc? on of the report has been s? mulated by an apparent lack of recogni? on and focus on coastal marine ecosystems to comple- ment ac? vi? es already well advanced on land to ad- dress the best prac? ce management of carbon sinks. The produc? on of this report is ? mely as a number of Governments are now introducing legisla? on to tackle climate change. In the UK, for example, the Climate Change Act sets out a statutory responsibility to quan- ? fy natural carbon sink as part of the overall carbon accoun? ng process. It is important that such quan? ? - ca? ons and processes work with the latest science and evidence. To construct this report we asked leading scien? sts for their views on the carbon management poten? al of a number of coastal ecosystems: ? dal saltmarshes, mangroves, seagrass meadows, kelp forests and coral reefs. The resultant chapters wri? en by these scien? sts form the core of this report and are their views on how well such habitats perform a carbon management role. These ecosystems were selected because the belief from the outset was that they are good at sequestering carbon, and are located in situa? ons where manage- ment ac? ons could secure the carbon sinks. There are of course other features of our ocean that are already established as good carbon sinks – the key focus for this ini? al work has, however, been on those ecosystems where management interven? on can reasonably read- ily play a role in securing and improving the future state of the given carbon sinks. If proven this work could ex- pand the range of global op? ons for carbon manage- ment into coastal marine environments, unlocking many possibili? es for ac? on and possible ? nancing of new management measures to protect the important carbon sinks},

Although the genus currently contains four accepted species based on variable holdfast and blade morphology [M. pyrifera (L.) C. Agardh, M. integrifolia Bory, M. angustifolia Bory, and M. laevis C. H. Hay], numerous recent studies on Macrocystis interfertility, genetic relatedness, and morphological plasticity all suggest that the genus is monospecific. We reviewed this evidence and present an explanation for the extreme phenotypic plasticity that results in morphological variability within Macrocystis, driven by the effects of environmental factors on early devel-opment of macroscopic sporophytes. We propose that the genus be collapsed back to a single species, with nomenclatural priority given to M. pyrifera.},

The methodology is based on our own modifications of the Institute of Healthcare Improvement "Breakthrough Series" and the Northern New England Cystic Fibrosis Consortium. Because of similarities across practices and the availability of existing published practice parameters, the clinical genetics evaluation of the child with developmental delay or intellectual disability was chosen as the topic to be studied. The aim was to improve the rate of etiological diagnosis of those with developmental delays referred to each genetics center by improving the processes of care. Process and outcomes were evaluated. Four of five sites also evaluated the impact of array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) laboratory testing of such patients. There was significant site-to-site variation in the rate of new diagnoses by a-CGH with the average new diagnosis rate of 11.8{\%} (range 5.4-28.8{\%}). Barriers to implementation of the process and outcome data collection and analysis were significant and related to time pressures, lack of personnel or staff to support this activity, and competing quality improvement initiatives at the institutional home of some genetics centers.},

abstract = {We tested the ability of sporophytes of a small kelp, Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, to adjust their photosynthesis, respiration, and cellular processes to increasingly warm ocean climates along a latitudinal gradient in ocean temperature (∼4°C). Tissue concentrations of pigment and nutrients decreased with increasing ocean temperature. Concurrently, a number of gradual changes in the metabolic balance of E. radiata took place along the latitudinal gradient. Warm-acclimatized kelps had 50{\%} lower photosynthetic rates and 90{\%} lower respiration rates at the optimum temperature than did cool-acclimatized kelps. A reduction in temperature sensitivity was also observed as a reduction in Q10-values from cool- to warm-acclimatized kelps for gross photosynthesis (Q10: 3.35 to 1.45) and respiration (Q10: 3.82 to 1.65). Respiration rates were more sensitive to increasing experimental temperatures (10{\%} higher Q10-values) than photosynthesis and had a higher optimum temperature, irrespective of sampling location. To maintain a positive carbon balance, E. radiata increased the critical light demand (Ec) exponentially with increasing experimental temperature. The temperature dependency of Ec was, however, weakened with increasing ocean temperature, such that the critical light demand was relaxed in kelp acclimated to higher ocean temperatures. Nevertheless, calculations of critical depth limits suggested that direct effects of future temperature increases are unlikely to be as strong as effects of reduced water clarity, another globally increasing problem in coastal areas.},

abstract = {Recent studies have emphasized the role of positive interactions in ecological communities, but few have addressed how positive interactions are mediated by abiotic stress and biotic interactions. Here, I investigate the effect of a facilitator species on the abundance of macroalgae over a gradient of herbivory. Grazing by sea urchins can be intense on temperate reefs along the California coast, with benthic macroalgae growing exclusively in physical refuges and interspersed within colonies of the strawberry anemone, Corynactis californica. Field experiments indicated that the net effect of C. californica on turf algae was strongly nonlinear over a gradient in density of sea urchins. At low intensities of urchin grazing, the anemone and macroalgae competed for space, with algae capable of overgrowing C. californica. At intermediate grazing intensities, C. californica provided a refuge for turf algae but not for juvenile kelp. Neither turf algae nor kelp benefited from the presence of C. californica at the highest levels of grazing intensity, as sea urchins consumed nearly all macroalgae. The hump-shaped effect observed for C. californica contrasts with the prevailing view in ecological theory that positive interactions are more common in harsh environmental conditions. The results reported here qualify this view and underscore the need to evaluate positive interactions over a range of abiotic stress and consumer pressure.},

abstract = {Indirect facilitation can occur when a species positively affects another via the suppression of a shared competitor. In giant kelp forests, shade from the canopy of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, negatively affects understory algae, which compete with sessile invertebrates for space. This raises the possibility that giant kelp indirectly facilitates sessile invertebrates, via suppression of understory algae. We evaluated the effect of giant kelp on the relative abundance of algae and invertebrates by experimentally manipulating kelp abundance on large artificial reefs located off San Clemente, California, USA. The experiments revealed a negative effect of giant kelp on both light availability and understory algal abundance and a positive effect on the abundance of sessile invertebrates, which was consistent with an indirect effect mediated by shade from the kelp canopy. The importance of these processes to temporal variability in benthic community structure was evaluated at 16 locations on natural reefs off Santa Barbara, California, over an eight-year period. Interannual variability in the abundance of understory algae and in the abundance of sessile invertebrates was significantly and positively related to interannual variability in the abundance of giant kelp. Analysis of these observational data using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that the magnitude of the indirect effect of giant kelp on invertebrates was six times larger than the direct effect on invertebrates. Results suggest that the dynamics of this system are driven by variability in the abundance of a single structure-forming species that has indirect positive, as well as direct negative, effects on associated species.},

One large-scale event has been reported where kelp forests along the Norwegian and Russian coast were grazed by sea urchins during the early 1970s. The barren ground area has persisted since. Different theories to explain the grazing event have been presented. This paper seeks to sort and summarize earlier published papers and national reports and to critically examine the most important theories presented to explain the grazing event. The conclusion is that the reason for the event is unknown and it is too late to find causes 40 years after it took place. However, new data and new geographical analysis tools provide insight into the extent and consequences of this dramatic event, and show re-vegetation of kelp forests in the southernmost area. Emphasis in future studies should be given to understand the reasons for shifts between the two ecosystem states and take advantage of the ongoing shift. Such basic ecological knowledge could provide an important basis for better understanding the system and further, to understand the extent to which other observed large- scale changes (e.g. climatic changes, fish stock reductions) affect kelp forestsea urchin interaction.},

Fishing substantially influenced the population characteristics of many species, including altering the mean size and abundance of rock lobsters and the abundance of prey species such as urchins and abalone. Strong declines in abundances of purple urchins and abalone within the largest MPA at Maria Island indicate likely indirect effects related to protection of predators from fishing. The two smallest MPAs (ca. 1 km coastal span) generated few detectable changes. Our results affirm the importance of long-term monitoring and the value of MPAs, when sufficiently large, as reference areas for determining and understanding ecosystem effects of fishing in the absence of historical baseline data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. Policy initiatives that seek to recover lost habitats require the capacity to anticipate and suppress the mechanisms that drive loss. The replacement of forested landscapes by simple landscapes comprising of opportunistic or ‘weedy' species represents an increasingly common phenomenon across human-dominated systems. The failure of subtidal forests to recover from natural and human disturbance and their ultimate replacement by degraded habitats is recognized globally. The current lack of knowledge on whether such shifts can be reversed jeopardizes considerations of restoration policy within increasingly human-dominated landscapes.2. We critically assessed the model that recovery of canopies within remnant kelp forests in degraded landscapes (i.e. turf-forming algae that carpet space) is slower than in adjacent forested landscapes, but may be increased by removing turfs.3. After generating experimental disturbance, canopies recovered to their former state within forested landscapes, but not in remnant forests in degraded landscapes. Removal of turfs from spaces between remnant forests, however, enabled canopies to recruit and subsequently develop covers that matched those in remnant forests.4. Whilst the supply of canopy-forming propagules to degraded landscapes is likely to decline with gap expansion, we show that improvements to forest resilience and restoration are possible via policies that result in a reduction of turf covers. These results also support the model that regime-shifts need not be a product of synchronized loss, but can occur as a result of reduced rates of canopy-recruitment over broad areas and many years. Indeed, patterns of canopy-loss over several decades redouble attention to the human-mediated conditions that enable turfs to retain space (i.e. elevated nutrient and sediment loads via coastal runoff).5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that future restoration is a possible outcome of polices that promote ecosystem recovery. In doing so, we reduce uncertainty about policy initiatives that aim to upgrade the recycling potential of wastewater treatment plants (e.g. nearly 45{\%} of South Australia's metropolitan wastewater) to improve the quality of water needed to restore subtidal forests. Uncertainty about resilience-building and restoration management are redressed by demonstrating that the feedbacks maintaining regime-shifted landscapes are not necessarily permanent.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress.

abstract = {Although human-mediated extinctions disproportionately affect higher trophic levels, the ecosystem consequences of declining diversity are best known for plants and herbivores. We combined field surveys and experimental manipulations to examine the consequences of changing predator diversity for trophic cascades in kelp forests. In field surveys we found that predator diversity was negatively correlated with herbivore abundance and positively correlated with kelp abundance. To assess whether this relationship was causal, we manipulated predator richness in kelp mesocosms, and found that decreasing predator richness increased herbivore grazing, leading to a decrease in the biomass of the giant kelp Macrocystis. The presence of different predators caused different herbivores to alter their behaviour by reducing grazing, such that total grazing was lowest at highest predator diversity. Our results suggest that declining predator diversity can have cascading effects on community structure by reducing the abundance of key habitat-providing species. Keywords},

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that mapping of benthic diversity is needed to aid in the management and conservation of marine ecosystems, but the choice of scale is contingent upon the patterns of spatial structure inherent to the benthos, which are often unknown. In this paper, spatial autocorrelation analysis is used to detect and describe fine-scale patterns of spatial structure in assemblages of epibenthic megafauna of the seabed below 20 m depth at the Koster fjord/archipelago area (Sweden). Presence/absence of benthic organisms was obtained from video images, which had been collected by means of a remotely operated vehicle. For sample sizes (grain) of {\textless} 1 m(2), and maximum between-sample distance (lag) of 200 m, rank-correlograms revealed the presence of patches in all 12 sites surveyed, and faunal homogeneity (positive spatial autocorrelation) was always detected within distances {\textless} 20 m, though there was variation across sites in the sizes of patches. These findings were further used to resample the data at coarser grain sizes, to enable exploring of the faunal composition of the patches. We conclude that spatial autocorrelation analysis can greatly improve the design of sampling schemes by ensuring parsimoniousness, and maximizing the chances of detecting patterns. The procedure shown here is especially well suited to carry out subsequent mapping because it can readily discriminate between types of biotopes.},

abstract = {Natural processes tend to vary over time and space, as well as between species. The ecosystem services these natural processes provide are therefore also highly variable. It is often assumed that ecosystem services are pro- vided linearly (unvaryingly, at a steady rate), but natural processes are characterized by thresholds and limit- ing functions. In this paper, we describe the variability observed in wave attenuation provided by marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs and therefore also in coastal protection. We calculate the economic con- sequences of assuming coastal protection to be linear. We suggest that, in order to refine ecosystem-based man- agement practices, it is essential that natural variability and cumulative effects be considered in the valuation of ecosystem services.

abstract = {In almost any Atlantic coastal area of Europe where there is a suitable substratum and adequate water quality, one or more species of kelp may be found. Their high productivity and complex biological structure make kelps especially important members of their communities, particularly when present in dense stands known as "kelp forests". Currently, these species are subject to important novel constraints of physical and anthropogenic origins that can strongly modify their sustainability, their distribution and the biodiversity of associated species. Along the Portuguese coastline there is a perception by the local and scientific communities that some kelp species abundance is declining, particularly at the southern coast. Nevertheless, no large-scale spatial study of kelp abundance and diversity has been done. With the acronym Findkelp, this study aimed to assess from May to August 2008, the Portuguese kelp conservation status through community participation, field-based observations and large-scale Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. A communication strategy towards scuba divers and other coastal zone users was made to build and educate a team of informed volunteers that worked as independent observers, reporting georeferenced data in an electronic data-base available on the project's website. At randomly underwater chosen locations (n=56) from the volunteers reported sites (n=388), structural descriptors of kelp populations were groundtruthed, by means of non-destructive sampling techniques (3x50m belt-transects). By crossing the volunteer's reported data with the groundtruthed data, using error matrices and Kappa statistics with concordance agreement scales, a Portuguese coast line GIS map with perfect agreement (K=0.827) was made including the current distribution, diversity and conservation status of 6 kelp species.},

abstract = {The properties of food webs are examined to assess whether the correct properties are being modelled. The linkage arrangements and the extent of their variability and responses to local environmental change are examined using two webs from observations at Cape Flattery, Washington State and Torch Bay, Alaska. It is concluded that enumerating links through direct observations provides little information on a particular species' importance and the connecting component of food webs is susceptible to enormous geographic and within habitat variations. What counts is the competitive stature of the preferred prey, implying that cross-links will be as important as trophic ones. The evidence for strong interactions and some of their consequences as a unit are discussed. Basic data are given on 3 experiments in the marine environment that reveal the difficulty of examining weak interactions. The author concludes that trophic links are unequal in strength, and most benthic and aquatic communities seem to be characterized by high variance in this measure. Strong links ar easily demonstrated experimentally and their presence readily explains the cascading changes that characterize certain altered ecosystems. Further, predictable strong linkage can generate trophically different but persistent alternative resource bases. These later appear not to develop when the strong interaction is unpredictable in space or time. Finally, predictable strong interactions can encourage the development of modules or subsystems embedded within the community nexus. The individuals comprising these may be co-adapted to one another and exhibit sophisticated mutualisms.},

abstract = {Global warming is causing ocean warming and acidification. The distribution of Heliocidaris erythrogramma coincides with the eastern Australia climate change hot spot, where disproportionate warming makes marine biota particularly vulnerable to climate change. In keeping with near-future climate change scenarios, we determined the interactive effects of warming and acidification on fertilization and development of this echinoid. Experimental treatments (20–26°C, pH 7.6–8.2) were tested in all combinations for the ‘business-as-usual' scenario, with 20°C/pH 8.2 being ambient. Percentage of fertilization was high ({\textgreater}89{\%}) across all treatments. There was no difference in percentage of normal development in any pH treatment. In elevated temperature conditions, +4°C reduced cleavage by 40 per cent and +6°C by a further 20 per cent. Normal gastrulation fell below 4 per cent at +6°C. At 26°C, development was impaired. As the first study of interactive effects of temperature and pH on sea urchin development, we confirm the thermotolerance and pH resilience of fertilization and embryogenesis within predicted climate change scenarios, with negative effects at upper limits of ocean warming. Our findings place single stressor studies in context and emphasize the need for experiments that address ocean warming and acidification concurrently. Although ocean acidification research has focused on impaired calcification, embryos may not reach the skeletogenic stage in a warm ocean.},

@article{Rothman2010a,
abstract = {In South Africa two species of kelp, Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida, occur in quantities sufficient for commercial use. Currently, the former species is harvested in large quantities (about 5 000 tonnes wet weight per year) as abalone feed. In order to set limits to the amount of kelp that may be harvested, it is necessary to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of kelp biomass. Biomass estimates are traditionally obtained by destructive sampling of kelp sporophytes from quadrats placed on the bottom. Scuba divers harvest the plants and weigh them ashore. This method is slow and labour-intensive, and severely limits the area of kelp bed that can be sampled. This study investigates several alternative methods to determine an easier, quicker method of estimating kelp biomass. First, morphometric data on both species of kelp were collected to investigate if there were easily measurable characters that correlate with the weights of individual sporophytes, which then could be used as proxies for destructive sampling. Second, floating quadrats were used to establish correlations between the density of kelp heads at the water surface during low spring tides and kelp biomass. Good correlations were found between (1) individual sporophyte weight and stipe weight for E. maxima (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.5693) and L. pallida (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.6175), and (2) individual sporophyte weight and stipe length for E. maxima (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.5828) and L. pallida (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.4817). Such measurements are time consuming and labour intensive, and require scuba and destructive sampling. However, using floating 1 m2 surface quadrats, good correlations were found between the density of kelp heads at the surface and the biomass of kelp (E. maxima, p = 0.0000, r2 = 0. 3469; L. pallida, p = 0.0000, r2 = 0.4785). Surface density measurements are more than eight times quicker than the traditional biomass determination method, are non-destructive, require fewer personnel, can be done by snorkelling and are unaffected by water clarity. Furthermore, harvesting for abalone feed is boat-based and targets only surface-reaching kelp. Sporophytes of E. maxima that reach the surface at low water spring tide comprise on average 62{\%} of the total biomass of kelp in these beds, so scuba should still be used where observations and measurements of subcanopy biota are required.

abstract = {Aim Shifts in species ranges are a predicted and realized effect of global climate change; however, few studies have addressed the rates and consequence of such shifts, particularly in marine systems. Given ecological similarities between shifting and introduced species,we examined howour understanding of range shiftsmay be informed by the more established study of non-native species introductions. Location Marine systems world-wide. Methods Database and citation searches were used to identify 129 marine species experiencing range shifts and to determine spread rates and impacts on recipient communities. Analyses of spread rates were based on studies for which post- establishment spread was reported in linear distance. The sizes of the effects of community impacts of shifting species were compared with those of functionally similar introduced species having ecologically similar impacts. Results Our review and meta-analyses revealed that: (1) 75{\%} of the range shifts found through the database search were in the poleward direction, consistent with climate change scenarios, (2) spread rates of range shifts were lower than those of introductions, (3) shifting species spread over an order of magnitude faster in marine than in terrestrial systems, and (4) directions of community effects were largely negative and magnitudes were often similar for shifters and introduced species; however, this comparison was limited by few data for range-shifting species. Main conclusions Although marine range shifts are likely to proceed more slowly than marine introductions, the community-level effects could be as great, and in the same direction, as those of introduced species. Because it is well- established that introduced species are a primary threat to global biodiversity, it follows that, just like introductions, range shifts have the potential to seriously affect biological systems. In addition, given that ranges shift faster in marine than terrestrial environments, marine communities might be affected faster than terres- trial ones as species shift with climate change. Regardless of habitat, consideration of range shifts in the context of invasion biology can improve our understanding of what to expect from climate change-driven shifts as well as provide tools for formal assessment of risks to community structure and function.},

During 2006–2007 we sampled seagrass meadows using the same gears and methods previously employed by R. J. Livingston in coastal waters of northwest Florida throughout the 1970s. Comparisons between datasets revealed numerous additions to the fish fauna during 2006–2007 that were completely absent in the 1970s, including: Lutjanus synagris (lane snapper), Epinephelus morio (red grouper), Chaetodon ocellatus (spotfin butterflyfish), Mycteroperca sp (grouper, non gag), Centropristis philadelphica (rock sea bass), Fistularia tabacaria (bluespotted cornetfish), Ocyurus chrysurus (yellowtail snapper), Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse), Abu- defduf saxatilis (sergeant major), Acanthuridae spp. (surgeonfishes) and Sparisoma viride (stoplight parrotfish). Several other species showed large increases in abundance during the interval between 1979 and 2006, including Mycteroperca microlepis (gag grouper, up ? 200?), Lutjanus griseus (gray snapper, up ? 105?), and Nicholsina usta (emerald parrotfish, up ? 22?). All of these are tropical or subtropical species that now make up a greater percentage of seagrass-associated fish assemblages in the northernGOMthan in the past. Additionally, we observed regional increases in air and sea surface temperatures (43 1C) during the ? 30 years that separate Livingston's samples and ours that correlate with northern shifts in the distribution of warm-water fishes. Documenting these range shifts is a critical first step in investigating the consequences of globalwarming for endemic marine communities and fishery production in the northern GOM. Keywords:},

Landscape effects on genetic connectivity are even less understood in marine populations, where habitat mapping is particularly challenging. In this study, we model spatial genetic structure of a habitat-structuring species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, using highly variable microsatellite markers. GIS mapping was used to characterize habitat continuity and distance between sampling sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel, and their roles as predictors of genetic differentiation were evaluated. Mean dispersal distance (sigma) and effective population size (Ne) were estimated by comparing our IBD slope with those from simulations incorporating habitat continuity and spore dispersal characteristics of the study area. We found an allelic richness of 7-50 alleles/locus, which to our knowledge is the highest reported for macroalgae. The best regression model relating genetic distance to habitat variables included both geographic distance and habitat continuity, which were respectively, positively and negatively related to genetic distance. Our results provide strong support for a dependence of gene flow on both distance and habitat continuity and elucidate the combination of Ne and a that explained genetic differentiation.},

abstract = {Breakwaters dominate shorelines in many coastal urban areas, providing substantial hard-bottom habitat upon which diverse and abundant reef communities develop. In recognition of their potential ecological and economic importance, there is increasing interest in understanding how design features can influence community development. We investigated the influence of wave exposure on breakwater coral communities in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Coral community composition, cover, size structure, recruitment, mortality, and growth rates were compared quarterly between two windward and two leeward breakwater sites for 1 yr to explore the influence of wave exposure on coral community development. Comparisons also were made with a natural coral reef to gain an understanding of how community structure and dynamics compare between these habitats. Benthic and water column sediment particle sizes were also analyzed. Leeward breakwaters contained a low-cover coral community dominated by small colonies with high mortality compared with windward breakwaters and the natural reef. Windward breakwater coral communities had comparable recruitment, mortality, and growth rates as the natural reef. Fine sediments ({\&}{\#}60; 63 {\&}{\#}956;m) dominated the benthos and water column on leeward breakwaters, while windward breakwaters and the natural reef were dominated by sediments with larger size classes ({\&}{\#}62; 125 {\&}{\#}956;m), likely as a result of differences in wave action among reef types. Overall, these results suggest that leeward breakwaters represent sub-optimal habitats for coral community development. However, with appropriate design, breakwaters can develop diverse and abundant coral communities with comparable coral cover, demographics, and growth rates to those on the natural reef in Dubai.},

Specifically, global water supply and demand as well as the linkages between water supply and food security are examined. The analysis reveals that the water for food security situation is intricate and might get daunting if no action is taken. Investments are needed today for enhancing future food security; this requires action on several fronts, including tackling climate change, preserving land and conserving water, reducing the energy footprint in food systems, developing and adopting climate resilient varieties, modernising irrigation infrastructure, shoring up domestic food supplies, reforming international food trade, and responding to other global challenges. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {An eastward shift in the West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii took place in the early 1990s along the south-west coast of South Africa in an area known as East of Cape Hangklip (EOCH). Given the predatory capabilities of J. lalandii, an intricate relationship between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and juvenile abalone Haliotis midae, and an already over-exploited ecosystem, the lobster ‘invasion' is assumed to have had serious consequences on the benthic community and associated fisheries. To investigate these effects, I used both empirical and modelling approaches. Based on field studies, I first analysed temporal changes in rock lobsters and the benthic community at two lobster-invaded sites EOCH. Prior to 1990, rock lobsters were rare EOCH, but from the mid 1990s onwards they achieved densities of 0.4- 0.8 m-2. The pre-invaded benthic community was significantly different from the post- invaded community at both sites. Three major changes followed the lobster invasion: (1) a decline or even a disappearance of herbivores (a direct effect), (2) macroalgal proliferation (an indirect effect) and (3) increases of a range of sessile taxa (unknown effect). This was followed by a detailed spatial analysis of J. lalandii densities and the benthic community EOCH, in which I surveyed six sites (three invaded and three non- invaded) at three different depth zones ({\textless}5 m, 6-12 m and 13-20 m). At all three depth zones Jasus lalandii was significantly more abundant in invaded areas than in non- invaded areas, and invaded and non-invaded benthic communities were significantly different. Invaded sites were characterized by higher densities of rock lobsters, macroalgae and sessile species, whereas non-invaded sites had greater amounts of herbivores and encrusting corallines. Abalone abundance reflected their previously- University Of Cape Town recorded dependency on urchins and the effects of rampant poaching. Floral species diversity was on average greater at invaded sites and increased with depth, whereas faunal species diversity was greater at non-invaded sites but also increased with depth. The depths in which strongest effects of J. lalandii were felt coincided with the depth of maximum abundance of the urchin Parechinus angulosus, the abalone Haliotis midae, the kelp Ecklonia maxima and encrusting corallines. In line with an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and to better understand the ecosystem dynamics EOCH, a lobster-urchin-abalone Minimally Realistic Model was developed for a lobster-invaded area, and an adjacent non- invaded area. A key feature of the model is that its focus was restricted to the critical interactions of interest and was fitted to all available data. An existing abalone stock- assessment model formed the foundation of this multispecies model, to which rock lobsters and urchins were added. Abalone and rock lobsters were modelled using age- structured production models and urchins were modelled using a simpler surplus production model because of data limitations. The model estimated a lobster starting biomass (in 1985) of 314 tonnes (MT) and a carrying capacity of 1511 MT. Species- interaction parameters, particularly the lobster-abalone interaction, were difficult to estimate and the model was unable to estimate the urchin intrinsic growth rate parameter because the data had insufficient contrast. Results from the model suggest that the lobster invasion was probably caused by an influx of adult lobsters as opposed to increased larval settlement. Future projections suggest that given the virtual disappearance of urchins, complete removal of rock lobsters would be needed to allow the urchin population to re-establish itself. Recovery of urchins could take up to 50 years and recovery of abalone would take even longer. The model-predicted differences in lobsters, abalone and urchins between invaded and non-invaded areas paralleled empirical data. Further model explorations included (1) a hypothetical lobster invasion into a currently non-invaded zone EOCH and (2) the addition of a top fish predator into a lobster-invaded zone. Various hypothetical lobster invasions into the non-invaded zone all resulted in the eventual disappearance of urchins and, consequently, juvenile abalone. Available catch and effort data for fish indicated that a major decline in linefish has taken place, but that this occurred prior to the 1980s and was thus not the direct cause of the rock-lobster invasion. This was supported by outputs of a model University Of Cape Town incorporating fish predation, which demonstrated that the presently over-exploited fish biomass has very little effect on the rock lobster population, but that at historical pristine levels, fish would have been capable of preventing the establishment of a dense rock-lobster population and the consequent disappearance of urchins and abalone. These results indicate that the over-fishing of top-predators would have had massive ramifications for the rest of the ecosystem. Through dual empirical and modelling approaches, my study highlights the complexity of ecosystem interactions and the need for multispecies models in developing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, and adds to the understanding of the causes and implications of human- and environmentally-induced shifts in community structure},

abstract = {Sunken parcels of macroalgae and wood provide important oases of organic enrichment at the deep-sea floor, yet sediment community structure and succession around these habitat islands are poorly evaluated. We experimentally implanted 100-kg kelp falls and 200 kg wood falls at 1670 m depth in the Santa Cruz Basin to investigate (1) macrofaunal succession and (2) species overlap with nearby whale-fall and cold-seep communities over time scales of 0.25-5.5 yr. The abundance of infaunal macrobenthos was highly elevated after 0.25 and 0.5 yr near kelp parcels with decreased macrofaunal diversity and evenness within 0.5 m of the falls. Apparently opportunistic species (e.g., two new species of cumaceans) and sulfide tolerant microbial grazers (dorvilleid polychaetes) abounded after 0.25-0.5 yr. At wood falls, opportunistic cumaceans become abundant after 0.5 yr, but sulfide tolerant species only became abundant after 1.8-5.5 yr, in accordance with the much slower buildup of porewater sulfides at wood parcels compared with kelp falls. Species diversity decreased significantly over time in sediments adjacent to the wood parcels, most likely due to stress resulting from intense organic loading of nearby sediments (up to 20-30{\%} organic carbon). Dorvilleid and ampharetid polychaetes were among the top-ranked fauna at wood parcels after 3.0-5.5 yr. Sediments around kelp and wood parcels provided low-intensity reducing conditions that sustain a limited chemoautrotrophically-based fauna. As a result, macrobenthic species overlap among kelp, wood, and other chemosynthetic habitats in the deep NE Pacific are primarily restricted to apparently sulfide tolerant species such as dorvilleid polychaetes, opportunistic cumaceans, and juvenile stages of chemosymbiont containing vesicomyid bivalves. We conclude that organically enriched sediments around wood falls may provide important habitat islands for the persistence and evolution of species dependent on organic- and sulfide-rich conditions at the deep-sea floor and contribute to ?? and ?? diversity in deep-sea ecosystems. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Wave exposure is one of the fundamental variables of the coastal environment and many coastal processes are affected by waves and wave-induced water motion. Directly or indirectly, waves affect the lives of many coastal macroalgae and seagrasses. Although the idea that waves can affect macrophyte distribution and biodiversity is not new, it remains poorly examined. We looked at how a gradient of wave exposure, determined using the surf similarity number, influences the species richness of macrophytes among phyla and functional form groups. We suggest that wave exposure is a biologically and statistically significant variable and that the species richness of most phyla and groups decrease with increasing exposure. More interestingly, the analysis suggests that the Phaeophyta and the thick-leathery functional form group, which are associated with important coastal habitats (i.e. submarine forests), increases in species richness as exposure increases. It appears that the effect of wave exposure varies with phyla and functional form group. Consequently, we reinforce the belief that studies that address the biodiversity and distribution of macrophytes must include wave exposure as a measured variable, to provide any meaningful synthesis of the ecology of these organisms. {\textcopyright} 2010 Japanese Society of Phycology.},

abstract = {Aim In the Indo-Pacific, the mass of islands of the Indonesian archipelago constitute a major biogeographical barrier (the Indo-Pacific Barrier, IPB) separating the Pacific and Indian oceans. Evidence for other, more localized barriers include high rates of endemism at the Marquesas and other isolated peripheral islands in the Pacific. Here we use mitochondrial-sequence comparisons to evaluate the efficacy of biogeographical barriers on populations of the snappers Lutjanus kasmira and Lutjanus fulvus across their natural ranges. Location Pacific and Indian oceans. Methods Mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence data were obtained from 370 individuals of L. kasmira and 203 individuals of L. fulvus collected from across each species' range. Allele frequency data for two nuclear introns were collected from L. kasmira. Phylogenetic and population-level analyses were used to determine patterns of population structure in these species and to identify barriers to dispersal. Results Lutjanus kasmira lacks genetic structure across the IPB and throughout 12,000 km of its central Indo-Pacific range. In contrast, L. fulvus demonstrates high levels of population structure at all geographical scales. In both species, highly significant population structure results primarily from the phylogenetic distinctiveness of their Marquesas Islands populations (L. kasmira, d = 0.50–0.53{\%}; L. fulvus, d = 0.87–1.50{\%}). Coalescence analyses of the L. kasmira data indicate that populations at opposite ends of its range (western Indian Ocean and the Marquesas) are the oldest. Coalescence analyses for L. fulvus are less robust but also indicate colonization from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean. Main conclusions The IPB does not act as a biogeographical barrier to L. kasmira, and, in L. fulvus, its effects are no stronger than isolating mechanisms elsewhere. Both species demonstrate a strong genetic break at the Marquesas. Population divergence and high endemism in that archipelago may be a product of geographical isolation enhanced by oceanographic currents that limit gene flow to and from those islands, and adaptation to unusual ecological conditions. Lutjanus kasmira shows evidence of Pleistocene population expansion throughout the Indo-central Pacific that originated in the western Indian Ocean rather than the Marquesas, further demonstrating a strong barrier at the latter location.},

We tested the hypothesis that the morphology of the small kelp Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh is the product of an interaction between site (five reefs of different wave exposure) and the time of year that sampling occurs (summer vs. winter 2004). We determined that wave exposure had a strong directional effect on kelp morphology, with Reefs accounting for up to 43.4{\%} of variation in individual morphological characters. Times had a narrowly nonsignificant effect on overall morphology but accounted for up to 31{\%} of variation in individual characters. Many characters were affected by wave exposure, whereas only a few were (strongly) affected by time (e.g., thallus biomass). Interactive effects between Reefs and Times were generally small, accounting for 15.8{\%} of variation in lamina thickness, but much less for most other characters. We conclude that wave exposure exerts a strong control over the morphology of E. radiata, but that the nature of the effect depends on the magnitude of wave exposure. We also conclude that most of the effects of wave exposure are consistent through time and do not interact with cycles of growth and pruning in any major way.},

abstract = {Predictions about the ecological consequences of oceanic uptake of CO(2) have been preoccupied with the effects of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms, particularly those critical to the formation of habitats (e.g. coral reefs) or their maintenance (e.g. grazing echinoderms). This focus overlooks the direct effects of CO(2) on non-calcareous taxa, particularly those that play critical roles in ecosystem shifts. We used two experiments to investigate whether increased CO(2) could exacerbate kelp loss by facilitating non-calcareous algae that, we hypothesized, (i) inhibit the recovery of kelp forests on an urbanized coast, and (ii) form more extensive covers and greater biomass under moderate future CO(2) and associated temperature increases. Our experimental removal of turfs from a phase-shifted system (i.e. kelp- to turf-dominated) revealed that the number of kelp recruits increased, thereby indicating that turfs can inhibit kelp recruitment. Future CO(2) and temperature interacted synergistically to have a positive effect on the abundance of algal turfs, whereby they had twice the biomass and occupied over four times more available space than under current conditions. We suggest that the current preoccupation with the negative effects of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers overlooks potentially profound effects of increasing CO(2) and temperature on non-calcifying organisms.},

abstract = {Warming could strongly stabilize or destabilize populations and food webs by changing the interaction strengths between predators and their prey. Predicting the consequences of warming requires understanding how temperature affects ingestion (energy gain) and metabolism (energy loss). Here, we studied the temperature dependence of metabolism and ingestion in laboratory experiments with terrestrial arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this data, we calculated ingestion efficiencies (ingestion/metabolism) and per capita interac- tion strengths in the short and long term. Additionally,we investigated if and how body mass changes these temperature dependencies. For both predator groups, warming increased metabolic rates substantially, whereas temperature effects on ingestion rates were weak. Accordingly, the ingestion efficiency (the ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in all treatments. This result has two possible consequences: on the one hand, it suggests that warming of natural ecosystems could increase intrinsic population stability, meaning less fluctuations in population density; on the other hand, decreasing ingestion efficiencies may also lead to higher extinction risks because of starvation. Additionally, predicted long-term per capita interaction strengths decreased with warming, which suggests an increase in perturbation stability of populations, i.e., a higher probability of returning to the same equilibrium density after a small perturbation. Together, these results suggest that warming has complex and potentially profound effects on predatorprey interactions and food-web stability.},

abstract = {Coastal ocean upwelling ecosystems generally represent the most productive large marine ecosystems of the world's oceans, in terms of both primary production rates and tonnages of exploitable fish produced. The Peruvian upwelling system, in particular, stands out as a major factor in world fish production. The Pacific trade winds have traditionally been considered to be the primary driving force for the upwelling system off Peru, but are projected to weaken as climate change proceeds. This leads to concern that the upwelling process in the Peru system, to which its productivity is linked, may likewise weaken. However, other mechanisms involving greenhouse-associated intensification of thermal low-pressure cells over the coastal landmasses of upwelling regions suggest general intensification of wind-driven ocean upwelling in coastal upwelling regions of the world's oceans. But although certain empirical results have supported this expectation, it has not been consistently corroborated in climate model simulations, possibly because the scale of the coastal intensification may be small relative to the scales that are appropriately reflected in the standard models. Here we summarize available evidence for the intensification mechanism and present a proxy test that uses variations in water vapor, the dominant natural greenhouse gas, to offer multiple-realization empirical evidence for action of the proposed mechanism in the real world situation. While many potential consequences to the future of marine ecosystems would codepend on climate change-related changes in the thermocline and nutricline structures, an important subset, involving potential increased propensities for hypoxia, noxious gas eruptions, toxic red tide blooms, and/or jellyfish outbreaks, may depend more directly on changes in the upwelling-favorable wind itself. A prospective role of fisheries in either mitigating or reinforcing this particular class of effects is suggested.},

abstract = {Management and conservation can be greatly informed by considering explicitly how environmental factors influence population genetic structure. Using simulated larval dispersal estimates based on ocean current observations, we demonstrate how explicit consideration of frequency of exchange of larvae among sites via ocean advection can fundamentally change the interpretation of empirical population genetic structuring as compared with conventional spatial genetic analyses. Both frequency of larval exchange and empirical genetic difference were uncorrelated with Euclidean distance between sites. When transformed into relative oceanographic distances and integrated into a genetic isolation-by-distance framework, however, the frequency of larval exchange explained nearly 50 per cent of the variance in empirical genetic differences among sites over scales of tens of kilometres. Explanatory power was strongest when we considered effects of multiple generations of larval dispersal via intermediary locations on the long-term probability of exchange between sites. Our results uncover meaningful spatial patterning to population genetic structuring that corresponds with ocean circulation. This study advances our ability to interpret population structure from complex genetic data characteristic of high gene flow species, validates recent advances in oceanographic approaches for assessing larval dispersal and represents a novel approach to characterize population connectivity at small spatial scales germane to conservation and fisheries management.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting and abating the loss of natural habitats present a huge challenge in science, conservation and management. Algal forests are globally threatened by loss and severe recruitment failure, but our understanding of resilience in these systems and its potential disruption by anthropogenic factors lags well behind other habitats. We tested hypotheses regarding triggers for decline and recovery potential in subtidal forests of canopy-forming algae of the genus Cystoseira. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By using a combination of historical data, and quantitative in situ observations of natural recruitment patterns we suggest that recent declines of forests along the coasts of the north Adriatic Sea were triggered by increasing cumulative impacts of natural- and human-induced habitat instability along with several extreme storm events. Clearing and transplantation experiments subsequently demonstrated that at such advanced stages of ecosystem degradation, increased substratum stability would be essential but not sufficient to reverse the loss, and that for recovery to occur removal of the new dominant space occupiers (i.e., opportunistic species including turf algae and mussels) would be required. Lack of surrounding adult canopies did not seem to impair the potential for assisted recovery, suggesting that in these systems recovery could be actively enhanced even following severe depletions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that sudden habitat loss can be facilitated by long term changes in the biotic and abiotic conditions in the system, that erode the ability of natural ecosystems to absorb and recover from multiple stressors of natural and human origin. Moreover, we demonstrate that the mere restoration of environmental conditions preceding a loss, if possible, may be insufficient for ecosystem restoration, and is scarcely cost-effective. We conclude that the loss of complex marine habitats in human-dominated landscapes could be mitigated with appropriate consideration and management of incremental habitat changes and of attributes facilitating system recovery.},

Southern bull-kelp (Durvillaea antarctica) has a broad distribution along much of the Chilean coast. This species represents an ideal model taxon for studies of coastal marine connectivity and of palaeoclimatic effects, as it grows only on exposed rocky coasts and is absent from beaches and ice-affected shores. We expected that, along the central Chilean coast, D. antarctica would show considerable phylogeographic structure as a consequence of the isolating effects of distance and habitat discontinuities. In contrast, we hypothesised that further south--throughout the region affected by the Patagonian Ice Sheet at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)--D. antarctica would show relatively little genetic structure, reflecting postglacial recolonisation.},

abstract = {Despite their ecological and economic importance, no summary of kelp global biogeography has been produced for almost two decades. The circumscription of the order Laminariales and familial and generic relationships in the group have changed considerably recently, in the light of molecular data. A global summary and geographical analysis of kelp species and their distributions (112 species in 33 genera) is presented. These data are analysed and discussed from the perspective of the new consensus of relationships within the group, and likely evolutionary events. The putative ancestors of the kelps occur and are overwhelmingly most diverse, in the cooler waters of northern Japan. The biogeographical evidence suggests three main lines of subsequent evolution: (a) a diversification producing the four ‘derived' families Alariaceae, Costariceae, Laminariaceae, and Lessoniaceae and most extant genera in the temperate northern Pacific, probably during the Miocene. (b) The evolution of an Arctic flora which invaded the North Atlantic following the opening of the Bering Strait ca. 5.5 Ma. (c) At least four separate crossings, by different genera, of tropical regions from Northern to Southern Hemisphere (and one in the opposite direction). The recorded impacts of man on these distributions have thus far been minimal, with the notable exceptions of Undaria pinnatifida and species of Saccharina (grown in aquaculture systems for human food). Most genera are monospecific, with many confined to either the western or eastern temperate North Pacific, whereas the distribution of the most species-rich genera (Alaria, Laminaria, Saccharina) includes the Arctic, and they are widespread in the North Atlantic. This rapid species-level evolution is hypothesised to have been promoted by the relatively recent invasion of the Atlantic by these taxa. The crossing of the tropics has occurred in warm-temperate species some of which occur and are sometimes abundant, in deeper water in today's tropics, refuting the widespread view that kelps are only present in cold-water habitats. Most of these Southern Hemisphere kelps are in the family Lessoniaceae, including the only genus not present in the Northern Hemisphere, Lessonia. The origins of this genus are unclear. Knowledge of the phylogeography of the Ecklonia/Eisenia complex is particularly important in understanding Southern Hemisphere kelp biogeography. A number of groups are undergoing active speciation and, with the lack of a consistent species concept, the species-level taxonomy of the group remains to be clarified. There is a great need for molecular phylogeographical studies to provide evidence for many of the hypotheses presented here based on distributional evidence and the currently accepted taxonomic framework.},

abstract = {It is increasingly argued that human-induced alterations to food webs have resulted in the degradation of coastal ecosystems and even their "collapse." We examined the evidence for this argument for Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) forests in southern California. Others have concluded that forests in this region collapsed between 1950 and 1970 as a result of sea urchin grazing driven by overfishing of sea urchin predators (sheephead wrasse and spiny lobsters) and competitors (abalone), and that the kelp forests recovered but are currently sustained as a result of a commercial sea urchin fishery that began in the early 1970s. Our examination of the historical record, primary publications, and previously unpublished data showed that there was no widespread decline in the region between 1950 and 1970, but there were localised declines in mainland kelp forests near the rapidly growing cities of Los Angeles and San Diego. The preponderance of evidence indicates that kelp losses were caused primarily by large increases in contaminated sewage discharged into coastal waters, sedimentation from coastal development, and the 1957-1959 El Ni??o. Increases in active sea urchin foraging were most likely a secondary effect following dwindling food resources. The forests recovered when sewage treatment improved and sewage outfalls were relocated. The effects of fisheries were explored by correlation analysis between kelp canopy cover and commercial sea urchin landings, and among fisheries landings for sea urchins, abalone, sheephead and lobster. These correlations were generally insignificant, but were often confounded by differences in the spatial scale over which the data were collected as well as factors other than simple abundance that affect the fisheries. However, where area-specific data were available, the landings of sea urchins generally tracked kelp abundance, most likely because roe (gonad) development is directly related to food availability. A literature review showed that although sheephead and lobsters may control sea urchin abundance at small spatial scales within some sites, there is little evidence they do so over large areas. That abalone and sea urchins compete, such that sea urchins increased as a result of abalone harvesting, is largely conjecture based on their similar habitat and food utilization. This study shows that kelp forests in southern California did not collapse, and that declines in some coastal sites were caused primarily by degradation of water quality, increased sedimentation and contamination, and unfavorable oceanographic conditions. We conclude that management by species' protection or reserves will not be effective if poor habitat quality impacts the ability of giant kelp to survive and thrive. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The rock lobster Jasus lalandii expanded its centre of distribution south-eastwards into an area known as ‘East of Cape Hangklip' on the south-west coast of South Africa in the early 1990s. Using histori- cal and present data, we analysed differences in the abundance of key species and functional groups between the pre- and post-rock lobster invasion periods at two sites along that coast: Cape Hangklip and Betty's Bay. Pre-1989, lobsters were absent, but after 1995 they reached densities approximat- ing 0.4–0.8 m–2 . Benthic community composition also changed significantly with herbivores being abundant whereas macroalgae and sessile invertebrates were scarce pre-invasion. We attribute the decline of herbivores to the direct effects of lobster predation, in turn indirectly promoting macroalgae. Post-invasion sessile invertebrates and macroalgae increased by 2 600{\%} and 453{\%} respectively, whereas herbivores declined by 99.3{\%}. The virtual elimination of the sea urchin Parechinus angulo- sus by rock lobsters has substantial implications for the commercial harvesting of the abalone Haliotis midae, because its juveniles are intimately associated with this urchin. The lobster invasion has thus not only led to a regime shift of the ecosystem but has also substantial economic consequences, which calls for an ecosystem approach to the management of the pool of commercially exploited resources in this region.

Using the 5′ mtDNA control region we show that 96{\%} of 1013 fishes sampled over a three-year period share one of two dominant haplotypes; 19 haplotypes were recovered in total, suggesting a genetically homogenous population of fish. Accordingly, haplotype and nucleotide diversities are low (h = 0.53, $\pi$ = 0.0014); an asymptotic haplotype accumulation curve suggests that few additional haplotypes exist. Comparing h and $\pi$ with other fish species shows that M. paradoxus and other southern African fish species have remarkably low genetic diversity values compared with other global marine fishes. Despite low genetic variability, frequency differences among M. paradoxus haplotypes suggest weakly structured populations between Namibia and South Africa. However, given the remarkably homogeneous mtDNA population genetic structure between fishes sampled along 1800 km, it is clear that faster evolving markers such a microsatellites are also needed before inferences can be made regarding stock identification and management of this species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Successful mitigation of negative effects of global warming will depend on understanding the link between physiological and ecological responses of key species. We show that while metabolic adjustment may assist Australasian kelp beds to persist and maintain abundance in warmer waters, it also reduces the physiological responsiveness of kelps to perturbation, and suppresses canopy recovery from disturbances by reducing the ecological performance of kelp recruits. This provides a warning not to rely solely on inventories of distribution and abundance to evaluate ecosystem function. The erosion of resilience is mediated by a shift in adult-juvenile interactions from competitive under cool to facilitative under warm conditions, supporting the prediction that positive interactions may become increasingly important in a warmer future. Kelp beds may remain intact but with a lower threshold for where additional impacts (e.g., extreme storms or reduced water quality) will lead to persistent loss of habitat and ecological function.},

Landscape effects on are even less understood in marine genetic connectivity populations, where habitat mapping is particularly challenging. In this study, we model spatial genetic structure of a habitat structuring species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, using highly variable microsatellite markers. GIS mapping was used to characterize habitat and distance between continuity sampling sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel, and their roles as predictors of genetic differentiation were evaluated. Mean dispersal distance (a) and effective population size (Ne) were estimated by comparing our IBD slope with those from simulations incorporating habitat continuity and spore dispersal characteristics of the study area. We found an allelic richness of 7-50 alleles/locus, which to our knowledge is the highest reported for macroalgae. The best regression model relating genetic distance to habitat variables included both geographic distance and habitat continuity, which were respectively, positively and negatively related to genetic distance. Our results provide strong support for a dependence of gene flow on both distance and habitat continuity and elucidate the combination of Ne and a that explained genetic differentiation.},

abstract = {Management and conservation of ecosystems relies on biodiversity data; however, broad-scale biological data are often limited. Predictive modelling using environmental variables has recently proven a valuable tool in addressing this gap. Wave exposure is a particularly important environmental variable that structures shallow reef systems, but it is rarely quantified across the large areas often used for predictive studies. Therefore, we investigated approaches that quantify exposure and can be readily applied across a large area. We generated 6 quantitative indices that emphasise different aspects of exposure using a numerical wave model and cartographic fetch mod- els. The utility of these indices for predictive modelling in shallow temperate reef systems was assessed by how well they explained community and genera-level algal patterns in Tasmania, Aus- tralia, which is a region that experiences a wide range of wave exposure conditions. Exposure indices were significant predictors of algal patterns, explaining up to 18{\%} of community level patterns and up to 37{\%} of the variance associated with the occurrence and cover of algal genera. Fetch-based indices in particular appear to be a viable option for quantifying exposure on shallow reefs. These indices can be generated within a Geographic Information System (GIS) program for specific sites of interest, along coastlines or on a grid, and are potentially accessible to ecologists. Quantification of exposure across broad regions using fetch indices will allow ecologists to makes advances in predic- tive modelling studies, but also facilitate studies that test the generality of hypotheses and mecha- nisms driving patterns previously observed using qualitative measures.

abstract = {We investigated the role of beach grooming in the loss of coastal strand ecosystems. On groomed beaches, unvegetated dry sand zones were four times wider, macrophyte wrack cover was {\textgreater}9 times lower, and native plant abundance and richness were 15 and {\textgreater}3 times lower, respectively, compared to ungroomed beaches. Experimental comparisons of native plant performance were consistent with our survey results: although initial germination was similar, seed bank, survival, and reproduction were significantly lower in groomed compared to ungroomed plots. Rates of aeolian sand transport were significantly higher in groomed plots, while native plants or wrack placed in that zone reduced sand transport. Our results suggest beach grooming has contributed to widespread conversion of coastal strand ecosystems to unvegetated sand. Increased conservation of these threatened coastal ecosystems could help retain sediment, promote the formation of dunes, and maintain biodiversity, wildlife, and human use in the face of rising sea levels.},

abstract = {The odacid fish Odax cyanomelas feeds on the kelp Ecklonia radiata, an important component of subtidal reef habitats on the central coast of New South Wales, Australia. Herbivory by Odax has a major impact on the structure and dynamics of discrete patches within larger stands of kelp at Cape Banks. This three-year study showed that each year, between August and October, approximately the same patches of kelp were denuded by preferential feeding on the meristem and primary laminae. This coincided with a variable pulse of Ecklonia recruits to the cleared patches, thereby generating patches of a single age-class of plants. Neighbouring areas of Ecklonia forest, non cleared by Odax, consisted of larger, perennial plants, which exhibited more gradual changes in abundance. The seasonal impact of Odax appeared to be due to a change in the behaviour of female Odax during their spawning period. Observations suggested that females aggregate at traditional sites prior to spawning with territorial males in adjacent areas of kelp forest. An alternative hypothesis, that Odax preferentially attacked stands of one-year old Ecklonia plants, was rejected by a field experiment; the establishment of experimental stands of one-year old plants did not lead to increased damage due to Odax or any change in the use of space by the fish. The generality of this effect of fish herbivory is unknown, but this and other Odax species are widely distributed throughout temperate Australia, where Ecklonia is the dominant laminarian alga. The effects of pulsed herbivory by Odax is contrasted to the more continuous grazing by sea urchins in the same system. The latter herbivore has been shown to maintain areas free of Ecklonia, the long-term effects of herbivory by Odax remain unclear.},

abstract = {Coupled biological and physical oceanographic models are powerful tools for studying connectivity among marine populations because they simulate the movement of larvae based on ocean currents and larval characteristics. However, while the models themselves have been parameterized and verified with physical empirical data, the simulated patterns of connectivity have rarely been compared to field observations. We demonstrate a framework for testing biological-physical oceanographic models by using them to generate simulated spatial genetic patterns through a simple population genetic model, and then testing these predictions with empirical genetic data. Both agreement and mismatches between predicted and observed genetic patterns can provide insights into mechanisms influencing larval connectivity in the coastal ocean. We use a high- resolution ROMS-CoSINE biological-physical model for Monterey Bay, California specifically modified to simulate dispersal of the acorn barnacle, Balanus glandula. Predicted spatial genetic patterns generated from both seasonal and annual connectivity matrices did not match an observed genetic cline in this species at either a mitochondrial or nuclear gene. However, information from this mismatch generated hypotheses testable with our modelling framework that including natural selection, larval input from a southern direction and⁄ or increased nearshore larval retention might provide a better fit between predicted and observed patterns. Indeed, moderate selection and a range of combined larval retention and southern input values dramatically improve the fit between simulated and observed spatial genetic patterns. Our results suggest that integrating population genetic models with coupled biological-physical oceanographic models can provide new insights and a new means of verifying model predictions.},

abstract = {Subtidal seaweed communities of the northern coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have not been studied before. At Sodwana Bay, we tested the hypotheses that the seaweed communities would (1) differ floristically with depth, (2) be more species-rich in shallower water, (3) show similar biomasses within the depth range sampled and (4) be affected (biomass and/or species composition) by sand. Samples were collected (using SCUBA) from reefs (‘sites') at depths of about 1m, 7m, 10m, 15m and 26m. Each sample comprised all macro- scopic (non-crustose) seaweeds within a 25cm X 25cm quadrat (five quadrats per depth). Environmental factors, including percentage sand cover and depth, were recorded. The seaweed communities were mainly compact turfs; a total of 82 Rhodophyta, 14 Chloro- phyta and eight Phaeophyta were recorded. Ordination (canonical correspondence analysis) and classification (Twinspan) of the data showed clear differences in the floristic composition (either as species biomass or presence/absence) with depth, mainly between shallow subtidal communities (0.5–1.0m depth) and those at intermediate depths (5.5–15.0m), followed by the deepest communities (25.7–29.0m) and those at inter- mediate depths. The shallow samples showed the greatest species diversity. Total seaweed biomass decreased significantly with depth and percentage bare (seaweed-free) substratum increased significantly with depth, possibly because of lower wave action, light penetration, or different grazing patterns. Sand (as percentage sand cover) also affected seaweed commu- nity composition, but this showed no pattern with depth. The algal communities on these reefs at Sod- wana Bay showed exceptional $\alpha$-diversity, with 104 taxa ({\textgreater}20{\%} of the recorded KZN flora) occurring in the total sample area of only 1.56m2 . The seaweed communities of northern KZN are structurally and floristically similar to those of other tropical coral reefs around the world.},

abstract = {Coastal populations are often connected by unidirectional current systems, but the biological effects of such asymmetric oceanographic connectivity remain relatively unstudied. We used mtDNA analysis to determine the phylogeographic origins of beach-cast bull-kelp (Durvillaea antarctica) adults in the Canterbury Bight, a 180 km coastal region devoid of rocky-reef habitat in southern New Zealand. A multi-year, quantitative analysis supports the oceanographically derived hypothesis of asymmetric dispersal mediated by the north-flowing Southland Current. Specifically, 92{\%} of beach-cast specimens examined had originated south of the Bight, many drifting north for hundreds of kilometres, and some traversing at least 500 km of ocean from subantarctic sources. In contrast, only 8{\%} of specimens had dispersed south against the prevailing current, and these counter-current dispersers likely travelled relatively small distances (tens of kilometres). These data show that oceanographic connectivity models can provide robust estimates of passive biological dispersal, even for highly buoyant taxa. The results also indicate that there are no oceanographic barriers to kelp dispersal across the Canterbury Bight, indicating that other ecological factors explain the phylogeographic disjunction across this kelp-free zone. The large number of long-distance dispersal events detected suggests drifting macroalgae have potential to facilitate ongoing connectivity between otherwise isolated benthic populations.},

abstract = {Synthesizing long-term observations at multiple scales is vital for understanding the environmental drivers of ecosystem dynamics. We assessed the role of several environmental drivers in explaining temporal and spatial patterns in the abundance of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in the Santa Barbara Channel between 1984 and 2009. We developed a novel method for estimating the canopy biomass of giant kelp from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery, which allowed us to examine the dynamics of giant-kelp biomass on spatial scales ranging from 100s of m 2 to 100s of km 2 and temporal scales ranging from several weeks to 25 yr. Comparisons of changes in canopy biomass with oceanographic and climatic data revealed that winter losses of regional kelp canopy biomass were positively correlated with significant wave height (r 2 = 0.50), while spring recoveries were negatively correlated with sea surface temperature (r 2 = 0.30; used as a proxy for nutrient availability). On interannual timescales, regional kelp-canopy biomass lagged the variations in wave heights, sea surface temperatures, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index by 3 yr, indicating that these factors affect cycles of kelp recruitment and mortality. Results from cluster analysis showed that the response of kelp biomass to environmental conditions varied among different subregions of the Santa Barbara Channel. The dynamics of kelp biomass in exposed regions were related to wave disturbance, while kelp dynamics in sheltered regions tracked sea surface temperatures more closely. These results depict a high level of regional heterogeneity in the biomass dynamics of this important foundation species. ¬{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract = {Abstract Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the annual frequency and severity of extreme weather events during the next century. Here we show that increases in the annual frequency of severe storms lead to a decrease in the diversity and complexity of food webs of giant kelp forests, one of the most productive habitats on Earth. We demonstrate this by linking natural variation in storms with measured changes in kelp forest food web structure in the Santa Barbara Channel using structural equation modeling (SEM). We then match predictions from statistical models to results from a multiyear kelp removal experiment designed to simulate frequent large storms. Both SEM models and experiments agree: if large storms remain at their current annual frequency (roughly one major kelp-removing storm every 3.5 years), periodic storms help maintain the complexity of kelp forest food webs. However, if large storms increase in annual frequency and begin to occur year after year, kelp forest food webs become less diverse and complex as species go locally extinct. The loss of complexity occurs primarily due to decreases in the diversity and complexity of higher trophic levels. Our findings demonstrate that shifts in climate-driven disturbances that affect foundation species are likely to have impacts that cascade through entire ecosystems.},

A total of 24,140 epifaunal individuals were counted from 30 holdfasts of each kelp species. Overall epifaunal abundances exceeded faunal abundances previously reported from holdfasts of other kelps. Three taxonomic groups, Amphipoda, Mollusca, and Polychaeta, accounted for ca. 85{\%} of all individuals. Total abundances increased with the amount of habitat available, quantified either as the volume or the area provided by the holdfasts. The multivariate structure of the epifaunal assemblage did not differ between holdfasts of the two kelp species. However, epifaunal assemblages responded differentially to the habitat attributes provided by each type of kelp holdfast: multivariate variation in the assemblage structure of epifauna was mostly explained by holdfast area and volume for L. hyperborea, and by the surface-to-volume ratio for S. polyschides holdfasts. Therefore, the physical attributes of biogenic habitats, here kelp holdfasts that better predict patterns in the assemblage structure of associated fauna can differ according to their different physical morphology, even though the overall assemblage structure of associated fauna was similar.},

abstract = {Ecological patterns are determined by the interplay between abiotic factors and interactions among species. As the Earth's climate warms, interactions such as competition, predation, and mutualism are changing due to shifts in per capita interaction strength and the relative abundance of interacting species. Changes in interspecific relationships, in turn, can drive important local-scale changes in community dynamics, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, and can potentially alter large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance. In many cases, the importance of indirect effects of warming, mediated by changing species interactions, will be greater-albeit less well understood-than direct effects in determining the community- and ecosystem-level outcomes of global climate change. Despite considerable community-specific idiosyncrasy, ecological theory and a growing body of data suggest that certain general trends are emerging at local scales: positive interactions tend to become more prevalent with warming, and top trophic levels are disproportionately vulnerable. In addition, important ecological changes result when the geographic overlap between species changes, and when the seasonal timing of life history events of interacting species falls into or out of synchrony. We assess the degree to which such changes are predictable, and urge advancement on several high priority questions surrounding the relationships between temperature and community ecology. An improved understanding of how assemblages of multiple, interacting species will respond to climate change is imperative if we hope to effectively prepare for and adapt to its effects. ?? 2011.},

Data on within-population gene diversity were found for only seven species and reflect differences in effective population sizes. In addition, we focused on the Brittany populations of Laminaria digitata, one of the most commonly harvested species in Europe, and re-sampled populations studied seven years prior.

Waves associated with winter storms were consistently higher in central California, and the loss of kelp biomass to winter wave disturbance was on average twice that of southern California. These observations that the more intense wave disturbance in central suggest California limited NPP by giant kelp under otherwise favorable conditions. Regional patterns of interannual variation in NPP were similar to those of wave disturbance in that year-to-year variation in disturbance and NPP were both greater in southern California. Our findings strong evidence that regional differences in wave disturbance overwhelmed those of provide nutrient supply and grazing intensity to determine NPP by giant kelp. The important role of disturbance in controlling NPP revealed by our study is likely not unique to giant kelp forests, as vegetation in many systems are dominated succession with dynamics by post-disturbance climax communities being relatively uncommon. The effects of disturbance frequency may be easier to detect in giant kelp because it is fast growing and relatively short lived, with cycles of disturbance and recovery occurring on time scales of years. Much longer data sets (decades to evaluate the role of disturbance relative to other centuries) will likely be needed to properly processes in determining patterns of NPP in other systems.},

abstract = {In comparison with terrestrial plants the mechanistic knowledge of chemical defences is poor for marine macroalgae. This restricts our understanding in the chemically mediated interactions that take place between algae and other organisms. Technical advances such as metabolomics, however, enable new approaches towards the characterisation of the chemically mediated interactions of organisms with their environment. We address defence responses in the red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla using mass spectrometry based metabolomics in combination with bioassays. Being invasive in the north Atlantic this alga is likely to possess chemical defences according to the prediction that well-defended exotics are most likely to become successful invaders in systems dominated by generalist grazers, such as marine macroalgal communities. We investigated the effect of intense herbivore feeding and simulated herbivory by mechanical wounding of the algae. Both processes led to similar changes in the metabolic profile. Feeding experiments with the generalist isopod grazer Idotea baltica showed that mechanical wounding caused a significant increase in grazer resistance. Structure elucidation of the metabolites of which some were up-regulated more than 100 times in the wounded tissue, revealed known and novel eicosanoids as major components. Among these were prostaglandins, hydroxylated fatty acids and arachidonic acid derived conjugated lactones. Bioassays with pure metabolites showed that these eicosanoids are part of the innate defence system of macroalgae, similarly to animal systems. In accordance with an induced defence mechanism application of extracts from wounded tissue caused a significant increase in grazer resistance and the up-regulation of other pathways than in the activated defence. Thus, this study suggests that G. vermiculophylla chemically deters herbivory by two lines of defence, a rapid wound-activated process followed by a slower inducible defence. By unravelling involved pathways using metabolomics this work contributes significantly to the understanding of activated and inducible defences for marine macroalgae.},

abstract = {Local adaptation in the sea was regarded historically as a rare phenomenon that was limited to a handful of species with exceptionally low dispersal potential. However, a growing body of experimental studies indicates that adaptive differentiation occurs in numerous marine invertebrates in response to selection imposed by strong gradients (and more complex mosaics) of abiotic and biotic conditions. Moreover, a surprisingly high proportion of the marine invertebrates known or suspected of exhibiting local adaptation are species with planktonic dispersal. Adaptive divergence among populations can occur over a range of spatial scales, including those that are fine-grained (i.e., meters to kilometers), reflecting a balance between scales of gene flow and selection. Addressing the causes and consequences of adaptive genetic differentiation among invertebrate populations promises to advance community ecology, climate change research, and the effective management of marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {MaxEnt is a program for modelling species distributions from presence-only species records. This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implica- tions for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies},

abstract = {1. Determining the extent to which coastal oceanographic processes facilitate connectivity of marine organisms underpins our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine communities. Continental boundary currents are a dominant physical influence on marine connectivity, but determining their effect has proved elusive because of difficulties in achieving replication of currents within the distribution of a single species. 2. Australia provides an unparalleled opportunity to address such questions because it has three replicate boundary currents within narrow latitudinal ranges that share continentally distributed species. We tested whether the strength of continental boundary currents influences coastal connectivity of a dominant foundation species (the kelp Ecklonia radiate). 3. Variation in the strength of different boundary currents produced entirely different patterns of connectivity in kelp with high connectivity in strong currents and low connectivity in weak currents. Spatial patterns of genetic structuring were also correlated with the nature and strength of currents. 4. Synthesis. This result has global implications; continental boundary currents are key drivers of marine connectivity and give predictive ability with which to understand variable ecologies of temperate coastlines world-wide.},

abstract = {Understanding connectivity remains a fundamental challenge to marine ecology due to technical limitations of tracking larval dispersal. Marine population genetic analyses are often used to make inferences about the scale of population connectivity. For species with a larval phase, pelagic larval duration (PLD) is assumed to influence the scale of connectivity. If PLD and genetic metrics are reliable proxies of connectivity, the 2 should be well correlated. Previous tests report conflicting results, with many reports that global F-ST (Wright's fixation index) correlates poorly with PLD, and one very high correlation of isolation-by-distance (IBD) slope, which is derived from F-ST, with PLD. First we clarify the expectations for the performance of these different proxies in light of the latest understanding of larval dispersal dynamics. We then test the hypothesis that IBD slope may be a more robust correlate with dispersal scale than global F-ST with a new dataset of recent marine genetic studies. Re-evaluation of previously published and new datasets revealed a consistent, moderate fit (R-2 similar to 0.30) between genetic and PLD proxies of dispersal (using either IBD slope or global F-ST), with significant improvement for small-scale ({\textless}650 km) studies (R-2 = 0.50), and important effects of marker type. Significant effects of number of individuals and number of populations sampled on the genetic metrics in our dataset suggest a common need for more robust sampling designs. These results synchronize previous studies on this topic and provide validation that PLD and genetic metrics typically reflect scales of dispersal, as intended, at least when sampling design is robust.},

Macrophyte inputs, primarily giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, exceeded 2.3 kg m−1 day−1. Mean wrack biomass varied 100-fold among beaches (range=0.41 to 46.43 kg m−1). Mean concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), primarily NOx −-N, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in intertidal pore water varied significantly among beaches (ranges=1 to 6,553 $\mu$M and 7 to 2,006 $\mu$M, respectively). Intertidal DIN and DON concentrations were significantly correlated with wrack biomass. Surf zone concentrations of DIN were also strongly correlated with wrack biomass and with intertidal DIN, suggesting export of nutrients from re-mineralized wrack. Our results suggest beach ecosystems can process and re-mineralize substantial organic inputs and accumulate dissolved nutrients, which are subsequently available to nearshore waters and primary producers.},

abstract = {Connectivity via the transport of detrital material from areas of high to low productivity may be an important determinant of secondary productivity and biodiversity in receiving communi- ties. On the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, detritus exported from subtidal kelp beds contributes to food webs in communities inhabiting deeper waters offshore. To estimate the amount of energy available via this pathway, we measured rates of detrital production via erosion of kelp blades in kelp beds at 5 sites varying in wave exposure. Specifically, we measured productivity and erosion of the 2 dominant species of kelp, Laminaria digitata and Saccharina longicruris, over 16 mo. We also examined the effect of environmental and biological factors on erosion rates, including temperature, wave exposure, grazing by snails and cover by the invasive bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. We observed clear seasonal and spatial patterns in productivity, with the highest production in spring. Erosion rate was highly variable across sites and seasons, and was strongly related to the cover of M. membranacea and the intensity of snail grazing at the distal end of kelp blades. Both factors cause tissue degradation, abrasions and perforations that weaken blades. Erosion rate was also positively related to water temperature and site exposure. Annual detrital production from the erosion of kelp blades increased linearly with kelp bed biomass, and ranged from 0.5 to 1.71 kg dry weight m–2 (150–513 g C m–2) across sites. These rates equal or exceed annual phytoplankton production off the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia and estimates of detrital production in seagrass beds in North America. KEY},

The importance of macroalgal rafting as a dispersal mechanism has remained uncertain, largely owing to lack of knowledge about the capacity of fauna to survive long voyages at sea and successfully make landfall and establish. Here, we directly document the rafting of a diverse assemblage of intertidal organisms across several hundred kilometres of open ocean, from the subantarctic to mainland New Zealand. Multispecies analyses using phylogeographic and ecological data indicate that 10 epifaunal invertebrate species rafted on six large bull kelp specimens for several weeks from the subantarctic Auckland and/or Snares Islands to the Otago coast of New Zealand, a minimum distance of some 400-600 km. These genetic data are the first to demonstrate that passive rafting can enable simultaneous trans-oceanic transport and landfall of numerous coastal taxa.},

The vertical and horizontal errors of the handheld GPS system are evaluated with an inexpensive external L1 patch antenna and a more expensive, nonpatch L1 antenna, resulting in vertical root-mean-square errors of 11 and 2.5 cm, respectively. In addition, bathymetric measurements at Bethany Beach, Delaware, were obtained using the kayak surveying system and compared to a wading and boat survey yielding a root-mean-square error of 17 cm.

abstract = {Patterns of community development on subtidal rocky reefs in Marmion Lagoon, southwest Australia, were investigated with a settlement panel experiment. We tested the hypothesis that community development would differ between outer and inner reefs lines, because exposure to swell and wave energy was significantly greater on outer reefs. Following a 14-month deployment, we recorded pronounced variability between panels and sites, but did not detect any effect of wave exposure on the structure of panel assemblages. Subsequent data exploration suggested the importance of the presence of kelp recruits (Ecklonia radiata) in structuring the overall assemblage. Panel assemblages with kelp recruits were significantly different in structure to those without, principally because of greater space coverage of encrusting coralline algae and less coverage of red turfing algae, spirorbids, and bryozoans. Mature E. radiata act as ecosystem engineers in subtidal rocky reefs in southwest Australia. Our results suggested the importance of young, recruiting kelps in determining patterns of early community development on newly available hard substrata.},

abstract = {Temperate Australia is a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and its waters have experienced well-above global average rates of ocean warming. We review the observed impacts of climate change (e.g. warming, ocean acidification, changes in storm patterns) on subtidal temperate coasts in Australia and assess how these systems are likely to respond to further change. Observed impacts are region specific with the greatest number of species responses attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia, where recent ocean warming has been most pronounced. Here, a decline of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore (sea urchin) and other trophically important reef organisms has occurred. Although, evidence of changes on other coastlines around Australia is limited, we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change. Because of the east–west orientation of the south coast, most of Australia's temperate waters are found within a narrow latitudinal band, where any southward movement of isotherms is likely to affect species across very large areas. Future increases in temperature are likely to result in further range shifts of macroalgae and associated species, with range contractions and local extinctions to be expected for species that have their northern limits along the southern coastline. While there is currently no evidence of changes attributable to non-temperature related climate impacts, potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data, experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidification will result in negative effects on calcifying algae and animals. More importantly, recent experiments suggest the combined effects of climate change and non-climate stressors (overharvesting, reduced water quality) will lower the resilience of temperate marine communities to perturbations (e.g. storms, diseases, and introduced species), many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity. Thus climate change is likely to, both by itself and in synergy with other stressors, impose change to southern Australian coastal species, including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coasts. Management of local and regional-scale stresses may increase the resistance of temperate marine communities to climate stressors and as such, provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate systems.},

abstract = {Abstract. Individuals of Centrostephanus coronatus, a diadematid sea urchin, restrict their graz- ing to relatively confined areas on subtidal rock surfaces. To determine the effects of Centrostephanus grazing on the composition and diversity of the attached biota within these areas, I removed sea urchins from an experimental site and photographically monitored subsequent events in marked quad- rats at monthly intervals for 27 mo. Grazed and ungrazed control sites were similarly monitored. These observations were supplemented by dietary data obtained from grazed control site urchins at the end of the experiment, permitting assessment of food preferences through the use of electivity indices. Taxonomic composition in the exclusion site changed dramatically following urchin removal, nearly converging to that of the ungrazed control site. Algae, sponges, tunicates, and erect bryozoa replaced encrusting coralline algae and encrusting bryozoa as the dominants. The urchin's diet in- cludes all of these taxa, and the most preferred ones increase most upon urchin removal. Taxonomic diversity increased in the exclusion site as a result of replacement of a small number of taxa which can withstand urchin grazing by a larger number of competitively superior ones which cannot. Thus the effect of Centrostephanus on the community is to decrease diversity where it actually grazes, but to increase diversity in the community as a whole by creating local environmental patches favorable to otherwise rare taxa},

abstract = {Southern Africa supports a rich marine biota of 12 734 currently described marine species. Although the distribution and overall species-richness patterns of several component taxa are well documented, studies considering range sizes are absent. This study considers range size frequencies and distribution patterns of seven major marine invertebrate taxa. The most commonly observed pattern of size frequency distributions is bimodal, with a predominance of species with either small or large range sizes, and few taxa with intermediate-sized ranges. This pattern is displayed by prosobranch and opisthobranch molluscs, polychaetes and amphipods, and for all invertebrate taxa examined combined. Peaks in small range sizes are likely a reflection of the numerous poorly sampled and/or endemic species in the region, while the high number of species with large range sizes can be attributed to the large proportion of widespread tropical Indo-Pacific species within the regional fauna. Overall, the largest peaks of range-restricted endemic species occurred around False Bay, Port Elizabeth, Durban, St Lucia and Maputo Bay. These areas are all situated at or adjacent to recognised biogeographic breaks for invertebrate assemblages, but coincidentally also tend to also be areas of enhanced research and shipping activity. The Cape Point region supports the highest number of endemics, with 73 species restricted to ranges of {\textless}100 km and 28 species to ranges {\textless}200 km.},

abstract = {We describe a model for the evolutionary consequences of plasticity in an environmentally heterogeneous metapopulation in which specialists for each of two alternative environments and one plastic type are initially present. The model is similar to that proposed by Moran (1992) but extends her work to two sites. We show that with migration between sites the plastic type is favored over local specialists across a broad range of parameter space. The plastic type may dominate or be fixed even in an environmentally uniform site, and even if the plasticity has imperfect accuracy or bears some cost such that a local specialist has higher fitness in that site, as long as there is some migration between sites with different distributions of environmental states. These results suggest that differences among taxa in dispersal and hence realized migration rates may play a here- tofore unrecognized role in their patterns of adaptive population differentiation. Migration relaxes the thresholds for both environ- mental heterogeneity and accuracy of plastic response above which plasticity is favored. Furthermore, small changes in response accuracy can dramatically and abruptly alter the evolutionary outcome in the metapopulation. A fitness cost to plasticity will substantially reduce the range of conditions in which the plastic type will prevail only if the cost is both large and global rather than environment specific},

In the most highly studied canopy-forming kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (the giant kelp), models of hydrodynamic and oceanographic phenomena influencing spore movement provide bounds on reproduction, quantify patterns of local and regional propagule supply, identify scales of population connectivity, and establish context for agents of early life mortality. Other analyses yield insight into flow-mediated species interactions within kelp forests. In each case, advances emerge from the use of ecomechanical approaches that propagate physical-biological connections at the scale of the individual to higher levels of ecological organization. In systems where physical factors strongly influence population, community or ecosystem properties, such mechanics-based methods promote crucial progress but are just beginning to realize their full potential.},

abstract = {The seaweed flora of Angola is relatively poorly known. Most of the 124 records listed for the country come from a 1974 British Natural History Museum expedition to the central and southern parts of that country. Previous biogeographic studies treated the Angolan seaweed flora as a whole and grouped it with those of certain West African islands as transitional between a Tropical West African seaweed flora (essentially extending from Senegal to Gabon) and temperate floras to the north and south of this truly tropical region. In the present study a total of 99 species and subspecies of seaweeds was collected from the intertidal zone and shallow sublittoral zones at five sites in the north of Angola and four sites in the south. The biogeographic distributions of our records were examined and compared with the temperate flora of Namibia to the south and the flora of Ghana to the north (as an example of a well-studied Tropical West African flora). Multivariate analyses of our presence/absence records showed differences between northern and southern sites (cluster analysis [Jaccard, average linkage] and detrended correspondence analysis). All Angolan sites were clearly different from floras of south, central and northern Namibia, which are considered to be strictly temperate in nature. Northern Angolan sites grouped more closely with Ghana than with southern Angolan sites. Distribution patterns within Angola are discussed in relation to monthly sea surface temperature data that were processed for this region. We conclude that the overall affinities of the Angolan seaweed flora, as represented by our collections, are Tropical West African, but with a well-developed temperate element in southern Angola (from about 13° S) comprising mainly cooler-water species from the Benguela Marine Province of Namibia and western South Africa. Our collections add about 45 species to the Angolan seaweed flora, raising the total number of species to around 169. This total approaches that of Ghana which, with about 200 species, is considered to have the richest seaweed flora in Tropical West Africa.},

Here, we took advantage of this gradient in ocean climate to explore affinities in the biogenic landscape structure of subtidal shallow reefs (the abundance of habitat patches), as well as in the assemblage structure of macroalgae and associated fishes, between each of 3 regions: Viana do Castelo (41.5° N), Peniche (39.2° N) and Sines (37.8° N). Five reefs were sampled to determine the abundance of biogenic habitats and the assemblage structure of macroalgae and fishes in each region. The structure of the landscape, and of macroalgal and fish assemblages, differed between Viana do Castelo and Peniche and between Viana do Castelo and Sines, but not between Peniche and Sines. Viana do Castelo was the only region with conspicuous kelp forests, while Peniche and Sines were dominated by patches of foliose turf-forming and filamentous algae. Our study revealed an abrupt macroecological change from northern Portugal to central and southern Portugal, suggesting a possible biogeographical reconfiguration and recognition of a wider transitional area from the Atlantic into Mediterranean waters.},

abstract = {Patterns of potential recruitment, survival, age-structure, density, biomass and pri- mary production were studied in the kelp Laminaria hyperborea along a wave-exposure gradient in western Norway. The distribution of L. hyperborea is positively related to wave exposure, and the present work aimed to study how demography and population dynamics are affected by wave exposure. Populations at 9 sites representing 3 different levels of wave exposure were investi- gated. The biomass and production of L. hyperborea doubled along the gradient from low- to high-exposure sites. This increase was caused by an increase in plant density and individual plant size. Recruits and sub-canopy plants made up the majority of all individuals at all sites, but poten- tial recruitment increased more than mortality rate among recruits and young sub-canopy plants as wave exposure increased, leading to a higher density of these small individuals at high- exposure sites. Despite their large numbers, recruits and sub-canopy plants were not important for total biomass and production, and variations in those parameters with wave exposure were largely driven by variations in the density and size of adult canopy plants. Canopy plants suffered higher rates of mortality at low wave exposure, leading to shorter longevity and lower density than at high-exposure sites. The density and individual size of canopy plants both increased by ca. 50{\%} with increasing wave exposure, explaining the higher biomass and productivity at high- exposure sites. We suggest that the high mortality rate, low density and small size of canopy plants at low-exposure sites is caused by a combination of high epiphytic load and self-shading, which may impair light conditions, affect nutrient uptake and increase drag on the blades during extreme wind events. The reason why plants at high-exposure sites reach a larger individual size remains unknown},

However, general worldwide declines in seagrass beds have been reported with (invading) bloom-forming seaweeds, which threaten to displace the seagrasses and change the ecosystem fundamentally. We compared the functioning of the community with the intertidal seagrass . Nanozostera noltii as the only macrophyte, in a mixed status with the invasive drift seaweed . Gracilaria vermiculophylla and with only . G. vermiculophylla as macrophyte. These assemblages represent different phases of seaweed invasion. Assemblage functioning was assessed as the metabolic state of the system based on carbon dioxide and oxygen metabolism during submerged and emerged conditions. Across all assemblages production rates were much higher during submerged than during emerged conditions. Assemblage productivity increased from monospecific . N. noltii, through mixed to monospecific assemblages of . G. vermiculophylla. However, the photosynthetic efficiency at low light intensities ($\alpha$) of . N. noltii assemblages was higher than those dominated by . G. vermiculophylla. Metabolic performance patterns were mainly caused by increasing macrophyte biomass from . N. noltii to . G. vermiculophylla dominated assemblages. Therefore, with the shift from . N. noltii to . G. vermiculophylla domination, it is likely that these communities will become less efficient, but their productivity will increase considerably. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The mechanisms by which non-indigenous species overcome resistance in native communities are not well understood but are fundamental to the ability of invaders to persist and spread once they reach alien shores. One of the most widespread invaders is the kelp Undaria pinnatifida. Here we test disturbance, competition and facilitation in its recruitment into intertidal algal communities in southern New Zealand. In field-based experiments, we manipulated native fucoid and U. pinnatifida canopies, as well as the abundance and type of understory turfing species, and provided various gap sizes in native communities. Undaria pinnatifida recruitment occurred almost exclusively on coralline turf and in the absence of canopies, both native and conspecific. Where the native fucoid canopy was removed, U. pinnatifida recruited into gaps of all sizes (5 × 5 cm, 25 × 25 cm, 50 × 50 cm), but the smallest gaps recovered their native canopy within several months and precluded further recruitment. Experimental manipulations of coralline turf showed that recruitment of U. pinnatifida was orders of magnitude greater where turf was present, regardless of the timing or sizes of clearances. Facilitation did not occur with other turfing species. Overall, native fucoids showed high resistance to invasion, but there was great facilitation by native coralline turf. Furthermore, as annual U. pinnatifida canopies disappear over summer, it is clear that coralline turf harbors the microscopic stages of U. pinnatifida that will form the following year's populations. As turfing species increase and persist following disturbances of native canopies worldwide, it can be expected that the recruitment dynamics of non-indigenous species will also change.},

abstract = {The subtidal region at Cape Banks, New South Wales, Australia, is char- acterized by large areas covered solely by encrusting coralline algae in association with large densities of invertebrate grazers. Orthogonal removals of these grazers: the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii; the limpets Patelloida alticostata, P. mufria, and Cellana tra- moserica; and the turbinids Australium tentiforme and Turbo torquata, were done at two sites and two times to investigate the interactions among these species and their effects on the algal community. These manipulations had large effects on both the algal and animal communities, although the type and intensity of these interactions altered at different temporal and spatial scales. Initially, the removal of urchins and/or all species of limpets resulted in a rapid increase in the amount of noncrustose algae in these areas. Removal of turbinids, however, had no significant effect. Where both limpets and urchins had been removed, the cover of foliose algae continued to increase quickly and was :80-100{\%} after 12 mo. In areas where only urchins were removed, the increase in the cover of algae was slower, and only approached 100{\%} after 18-24 mo. Where only limpets had been removed, 3 mo after an initial increase in the cover of filamentous algae the cover declined to be only slightly more than in control areas. These results were similar at all sites and times. In one series of removals, the effects of some of the species of limpets were separated. In this case, the increase in the cover of algae was found to be fastest when only P. mufria was left (the urchins and other limpets removed), than when all limpets and urchins had been removed. Initially, the removal of the urchins generally resulted in a large increase in the re- cruitment and density of the limpets. Approximately 1 yr following the removal of the urchins, however, the density of adult and juvenile limpets of all species had declined to near zero. Removal of the larger species of limpets, P. alticostata and Cellana, also increased the rate of recruitment of the smaller species, P. mufria. Thus, these invertebrate grazers, especially the sea urchins, appeared to be necessary for the maintenance of the areas of crustose algae. Similarly, the sea urchins were found to be necessary for the continued presence of the limpets within these areas. The strong effects of the urchins on this community, and the application of the situation to theories concerning keystone species and facilitation, are discussed in relation to the important but more subtle effects of the limpets},

abstract = {Kelps, brown algae of the order Laminariales, dominate rocky shores and form huge kelp beds which provide habitat and nurseries for various marine organisms. Whereas the basic physiological and ecophysiological characteristics of kelps are well studied, the molecular processes underlying acclimation to different light and temperature conditions are still poorly understood. Therefore we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological acclimation to light and temperature stress. Sporophytes of S. latissima were exposed to combinations of light intensities and temperatures, and microarray hybridizations were performed to determine changes in gene expression patterns. This first large-scale transcriptomic study of a kelp species shows that S. latissima responds to temperature and light stress with a multitude of transcriptional changes: up to 32{\%} of genes showed an altered expression after the exposure experiments. High temperature had stronger effects on gene expression in S. latissima than low temperature, reflected by the higher number of temperature-responsive genes. We gained insights into underlying molecular processes of acclimation, which includes adjustment of the primary metabolism as well as induction of several ROS scavengers and a sophisticated regulation of Hsps. We show that S. latissima, as a cold adapted species, must make stronger efforts for acclimating to high than to low temperatures. The strongest response was caused by the combination of high temperatures with high light intensities, which proved most harmful for the alga.},

However, with knowledge of typ- 5 ical hydrodynamic behavior of waste plastic material, models predicting the dispersal of pelagic and benthic plastics from land sources into the ocean are possible. Here we investigate three aspects of plastic distribution and transport in European waters. Firstly, we assess patterns in the distribution of plastics found in fluvial strandlines of the North Sea and how distribution may be related to flow velocities and distance 10 from source. Second, we model transport of non-buoyant preproduction pellets in the Nazar´e Canyon of Portugal using the MOHID system after assessing the density, settling velocity, critical and depositional shear stress characteristics of such waste plastics. Thirdly, we investigate the effect of surface turbulences and high pressures on a range of marine plastic debris categories (various densities, degradation states and 15 shapes tested) in an experimental water column simulator tank and pressure laboratory. Plastics deposited on North Sea strandlines varied greatly spatially, as a function of material composition and distance from source. Model outputs indicated that such dense production pellets are likely transported up and down canyon as a function of tidal forces, with only very minor net down canyon movement. Behaviour of plastic frag20 ments under turbulence varied greatly, with the dimensions of the material, as well as density, playing major determining roles. Pressure was shown to affect hydrodynamic behaviours of only low density foam plastics at pressures {\textgreater}60 bar.},

abstract = {Seaweeds are ecologically important primary producers, competitors, and ecosystem engineers that play a central role in coastal habitats ranging from kelp forests to coral reefs. Although seaweeds are known to be vulnerable to physical and chemical changes in the marine environment, the impacts of ongoing and future anthropogenic climate change in seaweed-dominated ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this review, we describe the ways in which changes in the environment directly affect seaweeds in terms of their physiology, growth, reproduction, and survival. We consider the extent to which seaweed species may be able to respond to these changes via adaptation or migration. We also examine the extensive reshuffling of communities that is occurring as the ecological balance between competing species changes, and as top-down control by herbivores becomes stronger or weaker. Finally, we delve into some of the ecosystem-level responses to these changes, including changes in primary productivity, diversity, and resilience. Although there are several key areas in which ecological insight is lacking, we suggest that reasonable climate-related hypotheses can be developed and tested based on current information. By strategically prioritizing research in the areas of complex environmental variation, multiple stressor effects, evolutionary adaptation, and population, community, and ecosystem-level responses, we can rapidly build upon our current understanding of seaweed biology and climate change ecology to more effectively conserve and manage coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {In marine ecosystems, rising atmospheric CO2 and climate change are associated with concurrent shifts in temperature, circulation, stratification, nutrient input, oxygen content, and ocean acidification, with potentially wide-ranging biological effects. Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.},

abstract = {Predicting consequences of ocean deoxygenation and ocean acidification for nearshore marine ecosystems requires baseline dissolved oxygen (DO) and carbonate chemistry data that are both high-frequency and high-quality. Such data allow accurate assessment of environmental variability and present-day organism exposure regimes. In this study, scales of DO and pH variability were characterized over one year in a nearshore kelp forest ecosystem in the Southern California Bight. DO and pH were strongly, positively correlated, revealing that organisms on this upwelling shelf are not only exposed to low pH but also to low DO. The dominant scale of temporal DO and pH variability occurred on semidiurnal, diurnal and event (days–weeks) time scales. Daily ranges in DO and pH at 7 m water depth (13 mab) could be as large as 220 $\mu$mol kg−1 and 0.36 units, respectively. Sources of pH and DO variation include photosynthesis within the kelp forest ecosystem, which can elevate DO and pH by up to 60 $\mu$mol kg−1 and 0.1 units over one week following the intrusion of high-density, nutrient-rich water. Accordingly, highly productive macrophyte-based ecosystems could serve as deoxygenation and acidification refugia by acting to elevate DO and pH relative to surrounding waters. DO and pH exhibited greater spatial variation over a 10 m increase in water depth (from 7 to 17 m) than along a 5 km stretch of shelf in a cross-shore or alongshore direction. Over a three-month time period, mean DO and pH at 17 m water depth were 168 $\mu$mol kg−1 and 7.87, respectively. These values represent a 35{\%} decrease in mean DO and 37{\%} increase in [H+] relative to near-surface waters. High-frequency variation was also reduced at depth. The mean daily range in DO and pH was 39{\%} and 37{\%} less, respectively, at 17 m water depth relative to 7 m. As a consequence, the exposure history of an organism is largely a function of its depth of occurrence within the kelp forest. With knowledge of local alkalinity conditions and high-frequency temperature, salinity, and pH data, we estimated pCO2 and calcium carbonate saturation states with respect to calcite and aragonite ($\Omega$calc and $\Omega$arag) for the La Jolla kelp forest at 7 m and 17 m water depth. pCO2 ranged from 246 to 1016 $\mu$atm, $\Omega$calc was always supersaturated, and $\Omega$arag was undersaturated at the beginning of March for five days when pH was less than 7.75 and DO was less than 115 $\mu$mol kg−1. These findings raise the possibility that the benthic communities along eastern boundary current systems are currently acclimatized and adapted to natural, variable, and low DO and pH. Still, future exposure of coastal California populations to even lower DO and pH may increase as upwelling intensifies and hypoxic boundaries shoal, compressing habitats and challenging the physiological capacity of intolerant species.},

Seawater temperature anomalies of +2–4 °C were recorded at a number of locations, and satellite-derived SSTs (sea surface temperatures) were the highest on record. Here, we present seawater temperatures from southwestern Australia and describe, in detail, the marine climatology of Cockburn Sound, a large, multiple-use coastal embayment. We compared temperature and dissolved oxygen levels in 2011 with data from routine monitoring conducted from 2002–2010. A significant warming event, 2–4 °C in magnitude, persisted for {\textgreater} 8 weeks, and seawater temperatures at 10 to 20 m depth were significantly higher than those recorded in the previous 9 yr. Dissolved oxygen levels were depressed at most monitoring sites, being {\~{}} 2 mg l−1 lower than usual in early March 2011. Ecological responses to short-term extreme events are poorly understood, but evidence from elsewhere along the Western Australian coastline suggests that the heat wave was associated with high rates of coral bleaching; fish, invertebrate and macroalgae mortalities; and algal blooms. However, there is a paucity of historical information on ecologically-sensitive habitats and taxa in Cockburn Sound, so that formal examinations of biological responses to the heat wave were not possible. The 2011 heat wave provided insights into conditions that may become more prevalent in Cockburn Sound, and elsewhere, if the intensity and frequency of short-term extreme events increases as predicted.},

To accurately describe their condition it is often useful to examine the past, so that present conditions can be compared with those in the past. It is also important to realise the damage past oversights have had, with a view towards preventing similar occurrences from happening in the future. Ideally we need to know what the system's undisturbed baseline condition was. Trying to establish baselines is a challenging task, as it is not always possible to recall with accuracy the gradual changes over time. This has led to the term ‘shifting baseline syndrome' being coined by Pauly (1995). This illustrated review examines four main categories of change on the rocky shores of the Western Cape with the aid of repeat photography. The subjects of interest are: changes in range, climate change, intertidal invasions and direct anthropogenic effects.},

They also show great morphological plasticity, responding to specific environmental constraints, such as sea currents, reduced light availability, grazer attacks, desiccation and UV exposure.

abstract = {An eastward shift in the center of abundance of the South African rock lobster Jasus lalandii occurred during the early 1990s into an area known as East of Cape Hangklip (EOCH). Given (1) the predatory capabilities of J. lalandii, (2) an intricate relationship between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, and (3) existing over-exploitation of elements of the ecosystem, the 'lobster invasion' has major implications for the benthic ecosystem and associated fisheries. We surveyed the abundance of J. lalandii and the benthic community composition EOCH at six sites (three 'invaded' and three 'non-invaded' by J. lalandii), in three different depth zones ({\textless} 5. m, 6-12. m and 13-20. m). At all depths, J. lalandii was significantly more abundant in invaded areas than in non-invaded areas, and benthic communities were significantly different. The high densities of rock lobsters at invaded sites led to cascading effects including elimination of urchins and depletion of grazers, consequent enhancement of macroalgae, and diminishment of encrusting corallines. Non-invaded sites had few lobsters, abundant herbivores, less macroalgae and more encrusting corallines. Elimination of urchins in the invaded area has important implications, as juveniles of the commercially harvested abalone H. midae depend on shelter beneath urchins in this region. Floral species diversity was greater at invaded sites and increased with depth, whereas faunal species diversity was greater at non-invaded sites but also increased with depth. The depths at which strongest effects of J. lalandii were felt coincided with the depth of maximum abundance of the urchin P. angulosus, the abalone H. midae, the kelp Ecklonia maxima and encrusting corallines, with serious consequences for associated fisheries and the benthic community. We argue that the differences between invaded and non-invaded areas are sufficient to recognize that they are alternate stable-states and constitute a regime shift. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is an apex predator; a predator with no predator of its own, residing at the top of the food chain. Consequently, this animal is very well adapted to both hunting and killing, and is attributed to the majority of unprovoked shark attacks worldwide. Through human activity, such as finning (the removal and retention of the fins), the population of great white sharks has declined rapidly over recent years, earning them a vulnerable conservation status. Conservation of this animal is therefore necessary to prevent its otherwise inevitable extinction. Oceans Research are a group based primarily in Mosselbaai, South Africa, equipped with a dedicated team of scientists who aim to better the understanding of this animal, with the ultimate goal of conservation. I spent one month with this research group, assisting various research projects, such as behavioural and population based studies. Contribution from volunteers is essential to the running of this organisation, since scientific research can be particularly costly, both in time and money. During my stay, the team managed to tag and track their first small (1.5 metre) juvenile shark, giving an insight into the movement patterns of this size and age of shark, as compared with larger, more mature sharks. We also documented sightings of between 5-12 great whites daily, assisted research projects on smaller sharks in the laboratory, and contributed to the on-going cetacean population studies},

It emphasized the role of physical factors, grazing and nutrient limitation for phytoplankton, and the role of food limitation and fish predation for zooplankton. Although originally targeted at lake ecosystems, it was also adopted by marine plankton ecologists. Since then, a suite of ecological interactions previously underestimated in importance have become research foci: overwintering of key organisms, the microbial food web, parasitism, and food quality as a limiting factor and an extended role of higher order predators.

abstract = {There are at least 500 species of sharks inhabiting the world's oceans and very little is known about the reproductive biology of most of these species. By observing Scyliorhinids, which exhibit oviparous reproductive behaviour, we can further understand the nature of elasmobranch reproductive behaviour, including embryo growth and development. Two Scyliorhinid species endemic to South African waters are investigated here, Poroderma pantherinum, commonly known as the Leopard catshark and Haploblepharus pictus the Dark shyshark. Observations were made both in the field and in the laboratory to ascertain differences in reproductive behaviour. In the field P. pantherinumlaid their eggs at an average depth of 15.7 m ±28.8 and their preferred choice of substratum, onto which their eggs were singly attached, were seafans. H. pictus,on the other hand, laid their eggs at an average depth of 3.9 m ±15.9 and their preferred choice of substratum, onto which they attach their eggs predominantly in pairs, was the seaweed Bifurcariopis capensis.The average temperature at which the eggs were found were similar for both species (15°C) and eggs were observed to have been laid all year round. Observations of embryo development were made in the laboratory under different sets of controlled environmental conditions. The two temperatures to which the eggs were exposed were 14°C and 17°C and the condition of the water was either turbulent or still. Embryo length-age relationships were linear for both species. There was no significant difference in growth rate under turbulent or still conditions. There was, however, a significant difference in growth rate between embryos exposed to different temperatures. For P. pantherinumthe average growth rate in 14°C turbulent conditions was 0.048 cm/day ± 0.0001 and 0.05 cm/day ±0.0002 in 14°C still conditions. In 17°C inturbulent conditions it was 0.06 cm/day ±0.0005 and 0.07 cm/day ±0.0001 in 17°still conditions. The average incubation period for P. pantherinumwas recorded to be 39 weeks ±1.5 at 14 °C and 25 weeks at 17°C. The embryo grew 1.4 times faster in a temperature raised by 3°C. For H. University of Cape Town vii pictus,the average growth rate in 14°C turbulent conditions was 0.04 cm/day ±0.0003 and 0.05 cm/day ±0.0001 in 14°C still conditions. In 17°C turbulent conditions, the average growth rate was 0.09 cm/day ±0.001 and 0.07 cm/day ±0.001 in 17°C still conditions. The incubation period was recorded to be 30.7 weeks ±7.25 at a temperature of 14°C and 27.5 ± 1.9 at a temperature of 17°C. The embryo grew 1.8 times faster in a temperature raised by 3°C. The morphological changes taking place at different stages during development were recorded, including appearance of external gill filaments, opening of hatching slits, development of mouth and gills and absorption of external gill filaments. The change in yolk weight versus body weight was also calculated at different stages of development. The results indicate that an increase in body mass is directly proportional to a decrease in yolk mass. Development in the laboratory was also compared to that in the field. The results showed no difference in development of embryos exposed to a temperature of 14°C as to those in the field. Temperature recordings reveal that there were greater fluctuations in temperature, where P. pantherinumegg cases were found at {\textgreater}10 m as opposed to shallow waters, where H. pictuseggs were found. To determine whether P. pantherinumand H. pictusegg cases possess anti-fouling properties, live eggs, empty eggs and plastic panels were placed in the ocean at the depths at which eggs were naturally laid. The replicates were then harvested at intervals of three, five and seven months and the percent fouling cover on the different egg cases were compared. There was no significant difference in percentage cover of species between the different egg cases, however, there was a significant difference in percentage cover over time i.e. the longer the eggs were exposed to environmental conditions in the ocean, the more growth was observed on the egg cases. Different species colonized the egg cases, according to the depths at which they were placed. This indicates that light and temperature influence the settlement of different epibionts and there is some evidence suggesting that University of Cape Town viii the embryo/egg case has the ability to deter fouling for at least five months during development.},

abstract = {The investigation of submerged aquatic macrophytes in their natural habitat using metabolic fingerprinting may represent a comprehensive and sensitive approach in environmental sciences. The potential of metabolic fingerprinting for discriminating . Myriophyllum spicatum individuals growing in different lakes under varying environmental conditions was explored to determine its applicability in an ecological context. Low molecular weight compounds from hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts of leaves from individual plants were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with subsequent data preprocessing of the mass-to-charge fragments of metabolites using XCMS. Multivariate analysis was used to compare the metabolite composition of the plants in space and time at a fingerprint level. The technical variation in the signals was low compared with the biological variation between individuals. Variation of the metabolite composition of aquatic macrophytes retrieved at one site at a particular time was within the same range as described for algae and plants grown under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Thus, metabolic fingerprinting of . M. spicatum growing in the field is reproducible and biological responses can be detected. As a " proof-of-principle" , the approach was applied to study individuals from two lake populations, as well as one population over a three week flowering period. Distinct metabolic fingerprints were found for the individuals from two lakes and were shown to be associated with the nutrient status of these lakes. For the population characterized over time, metabolic fingerprints of individuals seem to be related to their state of ontogenetic development. These results suggest that the lake water chemistry is reflected in the metabolite composition of the submerged macrophytes and that developmental changes may lead to metabolic alterations. We consider metabolic fingerprinting to be suitable for studying physiological processes of aquatic macrophytes in their habitat and potentially applicable for environmental monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

Results show that faunal diversity increased with wave exposure, mainly due to increasing wave stress and habitat diversity.

abstract = {Past heat waves are considered harbingers of future climate change. In this study, we have evaluated the effects of two recent Central European summer heat waves (2003 and 2006) on cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic, shallow lake. While a bloom of cyanobacteria developed in 2006, consistent with our expectations, cyanobacterial biomass surprisingly remained at a record-low during the entire summer of 2003. Critical thresholds of abiotic drivers extracted from the long-term (1993-2007) data set of the studied lake using classification tree analysis (CTA) proved suitable to explain these observations. We found that cyanobacterial blooms were especially favoured in 2006 because thermal stratification was critically intense (Schmidt stability {\textgreater}44 g cm cm(-2)) and long-lasting ({\textgreater}3 weeks). Our results also suggest that some cyanobacterial species (Anabaena sp.) benefitted directly from the stable water column, whereas other species (Planktothrix sp.) took advantage of stratification-induced internal nutrient loading. In 2003, conditions were less favourable for cyanobacteria due to a spell of lower temperatures and stronger winds in mid-summer; as a result, the identified thresholds of thermal stratification were hardly ever reached. Overall, our study shows that extracting critical thresholds of environmental drivers from long-term records is a promising avenue for predicting ecosystem responses to future climate warming. Specifically, our results emphasize that not average temperature increase but changes in short-term meteorological variability will determine whether cyanobacteria will bloom more often in a warmer world.},

abstract = {The flow of detritus between habitats is an important form of connectivity that affects regional productivity and the spatial organization of marine ecosystems. Kelps form highly productive beds or forests that produce detritus through incremental blade erosion, fragmentation of blades, and dislodgement of whole fronds and thalli. Rates of detrital production range from 8 to 2657 g C m−2 yr−1 for blade erosion and fragmentation, and from 22 to 839 g C m−2 yr−1 for loss of fronds and thalli. The estimated global average rate of detrital production by kelps is 706 g C m−2 yr−1, accounting for 82{\%} of annual kelp productivity. Detrital production rates are regulated by current and wave-driven hydrodynamic forces and are highest during severe storms and follow- ing blade weakening through damage by grazers and encrusting epibionts. Detritus settles within kelp beds or forests and is exported to neighboring or distant habitats, including sandy beaches, rocky intertidal shores, rocky and sedimentary subtidal areas, and the deep sea. Exported kelp detritus can provide a significant resource subsidy and enhance secondary production in these communities ranging from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers from the source of production. Loss of kelp biomass is occurring worldwide through the combined effects of climate change, pol- lution, fishing, and harvesting of kelp, which can depress rates of detrital production and subsidy to adjacent communities, with large-scale consequences for productivity.},

abstract = {Beach grooming and beach award status are both shown to be associated with low macroinvertebrate taxon richness in Scotland. Previous studies in California have revealed that mechanical raking to remove wrack from sandy beaches has negative ecological consequences for coastal ecosystems. In the current study the presence and absence of eight common taxa that inhabit beached wrack on sandy beaches in Scotland was assessed at 60 sites, 24 of which were groomed and 29 of which were in receipt of a beach award. On average 4.86 of the eight taxa were found to be present on ungroomed beaches, whereas only 1.13 taxa were present on groomed beaches. Thus, beach grooming seems to be having a major effect on the biodiversity of beach macroinvertebrates in Scotland. Fewer macroinvertebrate taxa were also found on award (1.5) compared to non-award (4.38) beaches. It was also revealed that award beaches were much more likely to be groomed than non-award beaches, with 69{\%} of award beaches surveyed being groomed compared to only 6{\%} of non-award beaches. This pattern is surprising as the awarding bodies discourage the removal of seaweed and regulations state that beached wrack should only be removed if it constitutes a nuisance. It is concluded that award status, not nuisance level, has the main factor driving most beach grooming and that this has resulted in the substantial loss of macroinvertebrate biodiversity from award beaches in Scotland. In conclusion it is shown that beach grooming has a substantial negative impact upon strandline macroinvertebrate biodiversity in Scotland and that grooming is much more likely to occur on award beaches. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Kelps are highly productive seaweeds predominantly found in wave-exposed environments. Physical and biological processes such as sand abrasion, whiplash and grazing can wound kelp tissue, potentially weakening its ability to withstand wave forces. Despite the ecological importance of kelp tissue loss, few studies have quantified wounding patterns in kelps or how wounding might affect the biomechanical properties of kelps. We quantified the prevalence of wounds on 360 Ecklonia radiata kelps collected across 3 different reef lines (levels of wave exposure) in April (autumn), June (early winter), August (winter) and October (early spring) (i.e. before, during and after peak wave activity). Small holes in the centre of laterals dominated the wounds. Wounding pattern did not differ between reef lines but changed over time, with most in early winter and least in early spring (from 285 to 71 wounds kelp−1). This pattern suggests that wounds accumulate over summer and that highly wounded parts of the frond (but not the entire kelp) break off when encountering the first storms. Biomechanical break-force tests assessed the effect of experimental wounds on the forces required to break kelp tissue. These tests showed that holes or horizontal cuts to the edge of the kelp frond dramatically reduced the strength, extensibility, toughness and stiffness of the tissue. We conclude that wounds are common in E. radiata and that the resulting loss of tissue integrity, caused by even small damages, can dramatically increase the susceptibility to breakage. Our findings may have important ecological implications; the peak in wounds in early winter is likely to increase fragmentation of the kelp, thereby reducing its size and hydrodynamic drag, and, paradoxically, reducing the risk of fatal dislodgment during severe winter storms.},

abstract = {: Metabolomics is the analysis of endogenous and exogenous low molecular mass metabolites within a cell, tissue, or biofluid of an organism in response to an external stressor. The sub-discipline of environmental metabolomics is the application of metabolomic techniques to analyze the interactions of organisms with their environment. There has been a rapid growth in environmental metabolomics over the past decade. This growth can be attributed to the comprehensive and rapid nature of nontargeted metabolomics and the ability to generate hypotheses involving complex environmental stressors, especially when the mode of action is unknown. Using a wide variety of model organisms, metabolomic studies have detected stress from abiotic factors such as xenobiotic exposure and temperature shifts as well as biotic stressors such as herbivory and competition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics has been the dominant analytical platform used for environmental metabolo- mics studies, owing to its nonselectivity and ease of sample preparation. However, the number of mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic studies is also increasing rapidly, owing to its high sensitivity for the detection of trace levels of metabolites. In this review, we provide an overview of the general experimental design, extraction methods, analytical instrumentation, and statistical methods used in environmental metabolomics. We then highlight some of the recent studies that have used metabo- lomics to elucidate hitherto unknown biochemical modes of actions of various environmental stressors to both terrestrial and aquatic organisms, as well as identify potential metabolite shifts as early bioindicators of these stressors. Through this, we emphasize the immense potential and versatility of environmental metabolomics as a routine tool for characterizing the responses of organisms to numerous types of environmental stressors.

abstract = {The six spiny lobster species of the genera Jasus and Sagmariasus are the basis of some of the most important spiny lobster fisheries found in the Southern Hemisphere. These species inhabit rocky reef and foul ground habitats in shallow coastal waters. Many aspects of the biology of this group of spiny lobster species appears to be similar despite their circumglobal geographic range and their taxonomic diversity. Of the six lobster species, only J. lalandii, J. edwardsii and Sagmariasus verreauxi exist as more extensive populations on larger land masses that are all important resources as regional fisheries. The remaining three species, J. caveorum, J. frontalis and J. tristani (the last species is expected to be synonymized with J. paulensis), exist on small isolated oceanic islands and seamounts. In recent years there is new evidence that changes in ocean climate are beginning to show significant impacts on populations of several of the species of these genera. Given the biology of these species, especially their larval biology, it is likely that further change in ocean climate has the potential to greatly affect the production of these lobster species.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton growth rates are limited by the supply of iron (Fe) in approximately one third of the open ocean, with major implications for carbon dioxide sequestration and carbon (C) biogeochemistry. To date, understanding how alteration of Fe supply changes phytoplankton physiology has focused on traditional metrics such as growth rate, elemental composition, and biophysical measurements such as photosynthetic competence (Fv/Fm). Researchers have subsequently employed transcriptomics to probe relationships between changes in Fe supply and phytoplankton physiology. Recently, studies have investigated longer-term (i.e. following acclimation) responses of phytoplankton to various Fe conditions. In the present study, the coastal diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana, was acclimated (10 generations) to either low or high Fe conditions, i.e. Fe-limiting and Fe-replete. Quantitative proteomics and a newly developed proteomic profiling technique that identifies low abundance proteins were employed to examine the full complement of expressed proteins and consequently the metabolic pathways utilized by the diatom under the two Fe conditions. A total of 1850 proteins were confidently identified, nearly tripling previous identifications made from differential expression in diatoms. Given sufficient time to acclimate to Fe limitation, T. pseudonana up-regulates proteins involved in pathways associated with intracellular protein recycling, thereby decreasing dependence on extracellular nitrogen (N), C and Fe. The relative increase in the abundance of photorespiration and pentose phosphate pathway proteins reveal novel metabolic shifts, which create substrates that could support other well-established physiological responses, such as heavily silicified frustules observed for Fe-limited diatoms. Here, we discovered that proteins and hence pathways observed to be down-regulated in short-term Fe starvation studies are constitutively expressed when T. pseudonana is acclimated (i.e., nitrate and nitrite transporters, Photosystem II and Photosystem I complexes). Acclimation of the diatom to the desired Fe conditions and the comprehensive proteomic approach provides a more robust interpretation of this dynamic proteome than previous studies.},

abstract = {Species distributions have shifted in response to global warming in all major ecosystems on the Earth. Despite cogent evidence for these changes, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and currently imply gradual shifts. Yet there is an increasing appreciation of the role of discrete events in driving ecological change. We show how a marine heat wave (HW) eliminated a prominent habitat-forming seaweed, Scytothalia dorycarpa, at its warm distribution limit, causing a range contraction of approximately 100 km (approx. 5{\%} of its global distribution). Seawater temperatures during the HW exceeded the seaweed's physiological threshold and caused extirpation of marginal populations, which are unlikely to recover owing to life-history traits and oceanographic processes. Scytothalia dorycarpa is an important canopy-forming seaweed in temperate Australia, and loss of the species at its range edge has caused structural changes at the community level and is likely to have ecosystem-level implications. We show that extreme warming events, which are increasing in magnitude and frequency, can force step-wise changes in species distributions in marine ecosystems. As such, return times of these events have major implications for projections of species distributions and ecosystem structure, which have typically been based on gradual warming trends.},

Remote-sensing techniques have transformed ecological . research by providing both spatial and temporal per spectives on ecological phenomena that would otherwise be difficult to study (eg Kerr and Ostrovsky 2003; Running et al. 2004; Vierling et al. 2008). In particular, a strong focus has been placed on the use of data obtained from space borne remote-sensing instruments because these provide regional-to global-scale observations and repeat time series sampling of ecological indicators (eg Gould 2000). The main limitation of most of the research-focused satel lite missions is the mismatch between the pixel resolution of many regional-extent sensors (eg Landsat [spatial resolu tion of-30 m] to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer [spatial resolution of {\~{}}1 km]), the revisit period (eg 18 days for Landsat), and the scale of many ecological processes. Indeed, data provided by these platforms are often "too general to meet regional or local objectives" in ecology (Wulder et al. 2004). To address this limitation, range of new (largely commercially operated) satellite sen sors have become operational over the past decade, offer ing data at finer than 10-m spatial resolution with more responsive capabilities (eg Quickbird, IKONOS, GeoEye 1, OrbView-3, WorldView-2). Such data are useful for eco logical studies (Fretwell et al. 2012), but there remain three operational constraints: (1) a high cost per scene; (2) suit able repeat times are often only possible if oblique view angles are used, distorting geometric and radiometric pixel properties; and (3) cloud contamination, which can obscure features of interest (Loarie et al. 2007). Imaging sensors on board civilian aircraft platforms may also be used; these can provide more scale-appropriate data for fine-scale ecological studies, including data from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors (Vierling et al. 2008). In theory, these surveys can be made on demand, but in practice data acquisition is costly, meaning that reg ular time-series monitoring is operationally constrained. A new method for fine-scale remote sensing is now emerging that could address all of these operational issues and thus potentially revolutionize spatial ecology and environmental science. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are lightweight, low-cost aircraft platforms oper ated from the ground that can carry imaging or non-imag ing payloads. UAVs offer ecologists a promising route t responsive, timely, and cost-effective monitoring of envi ronmental phenomena at spatial and temporal resol tions that are appropriate to the scales of many ecolog cally relevant variables.

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been depicted as a useful tool for improving fishery management and protecting biodiversity. For example, by acting as source populations, MPAs may provide a spillover of adults/propagules, enhancing recruitment to surrounding, non-protected waters. However, such positive effect will depend on how a MPAs design matches population biology and dispersal abilities of the target species. High levels of intraspecific genetic diversity without pronounced structure have been found in many marine organisms over large spatial scales (from hundreds to thousands kilometres) but do not hold for other ecologically and economically important species such as coral reef fishes, seagrasses and kelps. In particular, the limited potential for dispersal of many macroalgae suggests the occurrence of self-sustaining, "closed" populations that contrast with the "open" populations of many fishes and invertebrates. Consequently, the high resilience of fish/invertebrate populations cannot be generalized to the whole marine realm. In the present work, we use genetic tools to explore the role of the MPA Parc naturel marin d'Iroise in the management of the emblematic kelp Laminaria digitata. While kelps have received much more scientific attention than any other seaweed group, there is still critical baseline knowledge which needs to be addressed for their effective management. Our genetic survey of 12 L. digitata populations along the Brittany coast, four of them located within the boundaries of the Parc naturel marin d'Iroise, allowed us to assess the conservation value of these kelp populations. In particular, classical genetic metrics as well as more recent clustering approaches were used to identify and characterize Management Units. Moreover, assignment tests were employed to determine contemporary migration events and source/sink populations. Our results show that populations within this MPA have high conservation value. However, we also identify other populations of conservation interest. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2012.},

Here we review previous ecological applications of MAR models and highlight their ability to identify abiotic and biotic drivers of population dynamics, as well as community-level stability metrics, from long- term empirical observations. Thus far, MAR models have been used mainly with data from freshwater plankton communities; we examine the obstacles that may be hindering adoption in other systems and suggest practical modifications that will improve MAR models for broader application. Many of these modifications are already well known in other fields in whichMAR models are common, although they are frequently described under different names. In an effort to make MAR models more accessible to ecologists, we include a worked example using recently developed R packages (MAR1 and MARSS), freely available and open-access software.},

abstract = {With marine protected areas being established worldwide there is a pressing need to understand how the physical setting in which these areas are placed influences patterns of dispersal and connectivity of important marine organisms. This is particularly critical for dynamic and complex nearshore marine environments where patterns of genetic structure of organisms are often chaotic and uncoupled from broad scale physical processes. This study determines the influence of habitat heterogeneity (presence of estuaries) on patterns of genetic structure and connectivity of the common kelp, Ecklonia radiata. There was no genetic differentiation of kelp between estuaries and the open coast and the presence of estuaries did not increase genetic differentiation among open coast populations. Similarly, there were no differences in level of inbreeding or genetic diversity between estuarine and open coast populations. The presence of large estuaries along rocky coastlines does not appear to influence genetic structure of this kelp and factors other than physical heterogeneity of habitat are likely more important determinants of regional connectivity. Marine reserves are currently lacking in this bioregion and may be designated in the future. Knowledge of the factors that influence important habitat forming organisms such as kelp contribute to informed and effective marine protected area design and conservation initiatives to maintain resilience of important marine habitats.},

The emergence of environmental metabolomics as one of the latest of the omics technologies has been one of the most critically important recent developments in plant physiology. Its applications broach the entire landscape of plant ecology, from the understanding of plant plasticity and adaptation through to community composition and even genetic modification in crops. The multitude of novel studies published utilizing metabolomics methods employ a variety of techniques, from the initial stages of tissue sampling, through to sample preservation, transportation, and analysis. This review introduces the concept and applications of plant environmental metabolomics as an ecologically important investigative tool.

Sea temperatures soared to unprecedented levels and warming anomalies of 2-4 degrees C persisted for more than ten weeks along {\textgreater}2,000 km of coastline. We show that biodiversity patterns of temperate seaweeds, sessile invertebrates and demersal fish were significantly different after the warming event, which led to a reduction in the abundance of habitat-forming seaweeds and a subsequent shift in community structure towards a depauperate state and a tropicalization of fish communities. We conclude that extreme climatic events are key drivers of biodiversity patterns and that the frequency and intensity of such episodes have major implications for predictive models of species distribution and ecosystem structure, which are largely based on gradual warming trends.},

Erosion was the largest contributor of detritus, accounting for 80{\%} of annual production. Most erosion occurred as a major pulse in autumn, whereas dislodgement was a minor and constant process throughout the year. Neither erosion nor dislodgement was correlated with water velocity (as often proposed), and this finding contradicts the common assumption that high dislodgement rates during peak wave action account for the bulk of detrital production. Together with low growth, the high erosion rate led to a severe reduction of individual kelp biomass in autumn (from 600 g to 300 g fresh weight kelp−1), reducing drag forces on kelp thalli by ∼ 50{\%}, likely reducing their susceptibility to dislodgement during peak wave action. Instead, a pulse of detrital production coincided with periods of peak kelp fecundity. We propose that sporogenesis weakens the tissue, making E. radiata more susceptible to erosion, and that the ensuing changes in kelp morphology decouple detrital production from the wave-action forces.},

abstract = {Understanding the extent to which neutral processes and adaptive divergence shape the spatial structure of natural populations is a major goal in evolutionary biology and is especially important for the identification of significant levels of biodiversity. Our results identified replicated habitat-specific (adaptive) phenotypic divergence in the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus that is independent of population (neutral) genetic structure. F.vesiculosus inhabits contiguous and contrasting marine to estuarine intertidal habitats. Combining analyses of genetic and phenotypic traits of populations living under differential selective regimes (estuaries and open coast), we investigated levels of neutral genetic differentiation and adaptive physiological responses to emersion stress. In southwest England (SW UK) and northern Iberia (N. Iberia), populations living in estuaries and marine coastal habitats were genetically characterized at six microsatellite loci. In N. Iberia, two clades with limited admixture were recovered, each including one open coast site and the adjacent estuarine location. In contrast, SW UK samples clustered according to habitat and formed three distinct groups of genotypes; one including the two open coast locations and the other two representing each of the estuarine sites. Temperature loggers revealed distinct emersion regimes that characterized each habitat type independently of the region, while water and air temperature profiles showed site-specific trends. Despite acclimation under usual conditions, trait means of emersion stress resilience showed a strong phenotypic divergence between habitats, consistent with environmental clines in exposure time observed in the different habitats. We demonstrate that neutral genetic clusters do not reflect locally adapted population units. Our results identified replicated habitat-specific (adaptive) phenotypic divergence that is independent of population (neutral) genetic structure in F.vesiculosus. The significance of such findings extends beyond the theoretical evolutionary and ecological interest of discovering parallel adaptive responses to the broader implications for conservation of intraspecific biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

As a case study of kelp detritus management, an observational study assessing the impacts of the practice of kelp burial at Clifton's 4th beach was conducted. Presented here is a review of the role kelp wrack plays in sandy shore ecosystems, descriptions of conflicts between and rationales of both DAFF and the Municipality, observations about beach sediment layers in areas of kelp burial on Clifton's 4th, and suggestions for management improvement for both specifically Clifton's 4th and the Cape Peninsula in general. Regulation by the Municipality was found to revolve around solely beach aesthetics, while management through DAFF deals with the collection of kelp for only commercial purposes. Though no patterns indicating the biological effects of kelp burial at Clifton's 4th beach were found, management suggestions for this beach include 1) the development of a map detailing location and date of kelp burial, and 2) investigation into the burial of beach-cast trash. Suggestions for management along the Cape Peninsula in general include 1) regular and improved communication between DAFF, the Municipality, and DAFF rights holders, 2) established protocols for dealing with conflict, 3) investigation into alternative use of kelp by the Municipality, and 4) records of quantities of kelp removed from beaches on the Cape Peninsula.},

We examined whether changes in SST correlated to the proposed decline in kelp forest. All investigated SST characteristics suggested to affect kelp abundance increased significantly during the past thirty years, reaching extreme values during the last decade. In addition over the past two decades, the landscape formerly dominated by both cold and warm temperate canopy forming and understory species changed to one dominated by warm temperate understory species, resulting in a loss of vertical community structure. Fisheries landing data of kelp associated species was used to support the suggested change in kelp abundance.

In light of climate change and the effects of ﬁre exclusion, single and repeated high-severity (stand-replacement) ﬁres have become prominent land management issues. We studied bird communities using point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon, USA at various points in time after one or two high-severity ﬁres. Time points included 2 and 3 years after a single ﬁre, 17 and 18 years after a single ﬁre, 2 and 3 years after a repeat ﬁre (15 year interval between ﬁres), and {\textgreater}100 years since stand-replacement ﬁre (mature/oldgrowth forest). Avian species richness did not differ signiﬁcantly among habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18 years after ﬁre, lowest 2 years after ﬁre, and intermediate in repeat burns and unburned forest. Bird community composition varied signiﬁcantly with habitat type (A = 0.24, P {\textless} 0.0001) with two distinct gradients in species composition relating to tree structure (live to dead) and shrub stature. Using indicator species analysis, repeat burns were characterized by shrub-nesting and ground-foraging bird species while unburned mature forests were characterized by conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning species. Bird density was not related to snag basal area but was positively related to shrub height. Contrary to expectations, repeated high-severity ﬁre did not reduce species richness, and bird densities were greater in repeat burns than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved hardwoods and shrubs appear to play a major role in structuring avian communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. In light of these results, extended periods of early seral broadleaf dominance and short-interval highseverity ﬁres may be important to the conservation of avian biodiversity.},

Zooplankton face challenges related to global warming, ocean acidification, the proliferation of toxic algal blooms, and increasing pollution, eutrophication, and hypoxia. They can respond to these changes by phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation. Using the concept of the evolution of reaction norms, I address how adaptive responses can be unequivocally discerned from phenotypic plasticity. To date, relatively few zooplankton studies have been designed for such a purpose. As case studies, I review the evidence for zooplankton adaptation to toxic algal blooms, hypoxia, and climate change. Predicting the response of zooplankton to global change requires new information to determine (a) the trade-offs and costs of adaptation, (b) the rates of evolution versus environmental change, (c) the consequences of adaptation to stochastic or cyclic (toxic algal blooms, coastal hypoxia) versus directional (temperature, acidification, open ocean hypoxia) environmental change, and (d) the interaction of selective pressures, and evolutionary and ecological processes, in promoting or hindering adaptation.},

abstract = {The genetic consequences of living on the edge of distributional ranges have been the subject of a largely unresolved debate. Populations occurring along persistent low latitude ranges (rear-edge) are expected to retain high and unique genetic diversity. In contrast, currently less favourable environmental conditions limiting population size at such range-edges may have caused genetic erosion that prevails over past historical effects, with potential consequences on reducing future adaptive capacity. The present study provides an empirical test of whether population declines towards a peripheral range might be reflected on decreasing diversity and increasing population isolation and differentiation. We compare population genetic differentiation and diversity with trends in abundance along a latitudinal gradient towards the peripheral distribution range of Saccorhiza polyschides, a large brown seaweed that is the main structural species of kelp forests in SW Europe. Signatures of recent bottleneck events were also evaluated to determine whether the recently recorded distributional shifts had a negative influence on effective population size. Our findings show decreasing population density and increasing spatial fragmentation and local extinctions towards the southern edge. Genetic data revealed two well supported groups with a central contact zone. As predicted, higher differentiation and signs of bottlenecks were found at the southern edge region. However, a decrease in genetic diversity associated with this pattern was not verified. Surprisingly, genetic diversity increased towards the edge despite bottlenecks and much lower densities, suggesting that extinctions and recolonizations have not strongly reduced diversity or that diversity might have been even higher there in the past, a process of shifting genetic baselines.},

Here we investigated the hydrodynamic behavior (density, settling velocity and resuspension characteristics) of non-buoyant preproduction plastic pellets in the laboratory. From these results we used the MOHID modelling system to predict what would be the likely transport and deposition pathways of such material in the Nazar{\'{e}} Canyon (Portugal) during the spring/summer months of 2009 and the autumn/winter months of 2011. Model outputs indicated that non-buoyant plastic pellets would likely be transported up and down canyon as a function of tidal forces, with only a minor net down canyon movement resulting from tidal action. The model indicated that transport down canyon was likely greater during the autumn/winter, primarily as a result of occasional mass transport events related to storm activity and internal wave action. Transport rates within the canyon were not predicted to be regular throughout the canyon system, with stretches of the upper canyon acting more as locations of pellet deposition than conduits of pellet transport. Topography and the depths of internal wave action are hypothesized to contribute to this lack of homogeneity in predicted transport.},

abstract = {Tracing the origin of nutrients is a fundamental goal of food web research but methodological issues associated with current research techniques such as using stable isotope ratios of bulk tissue can lead to confounding results. We investigated whether naturally occurring $\delta$(13)C patterns among amino acids ($\delta$(13)CAA) could distinguish between multiple aquatic and terrestrial primary production sources. We found that $\delta$(13)CAA patterns in contrast to bulk $\delta$(13)C values distinguished between carbon derived from algae, seagrass, terrestrial plants, bacteria and fungi. Furthermore, we showed for two aquatic producers that their $\delta$(13)CAA patterns were largely unaffected by different environmental conditions despite substantial shifts in bulk $\delta$(13)C values. The potential of assessing the major carbon sources at the base of the food web was demonstrated for freshwater, pelagic, and estuarine consumers; consumer $\delta$(13)C patterns of essential amino acids largely matched those of the dominant primary producers in each system. Since amino acids make up about half of organismal carbon, source diagnostic isotope fingerprints can be used as a new complementary approach to overcome some of the limitations of variable source bulk isotope values commonly encountered in estuarine areas and other complex environments with mixed aquatic and terrestrial inputs.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated whether failure of sea urchin recruitment can explain an ongoing phase shift from overgrazed, barren grounds to kelp forests along the coast of mid-Norway. Settlement of sea urchins on artificial substrates deployed in mid-Norway and North Norway was compared on barren grounds and in kelp forests. Settlement varied in time and space, and was low in mid-Norway—the area where kelp is recovering. Settlement did not differ between kelp forest and barren grounds. Densities of adult and juvenile sea urchins were estimated and gonad index (GI) was measured in order to relate sea urchin settlement to local population structure and the reproductive potential of the sea urchin populations. Sea urchin density was generally lower in mid-Norway than in North Norway, but reproductive potential did not differ significantly between the areas. Increasing water temperature is considered a critical factor for sea urchin larval development and may be partly to blame for the recent sea urchin recruitment failure in mid-Norway. Lack of sea urchin recruitment may explain the recovery of kelp in mid-Norway.},

abstract = {Kelp forests along temperate and polar coastlines represent some of most diverse and productive habitats on the Earth. Here, we synthesize information from {\textgreater}60 years of research on the structure and functioning of kelp forest habitats in European waters, with particular emphasis on the coasts of UK and Ireland, which represents an important biogeographic transition zone that is subjected to multiple threats and stressors. We collated existing data on kelp distribution and abundance and reanalyzed these data to describe the structure of kelp forests along a spatial gradient spanning more than 10° of latitude. We then examined ecological goods and services provided by kelp forests, including elevated secondary production, nutrient cycling, energy capture and flow, coastal defense, direct applications, and biodiversity repositories, before discussing current and future threats posed to kelp forests and identifying key knowledge gaps. Recent evidence unequivocally demonstrates that the structure of kelp forests in the NE Atlantic is changing in response to climate- and non-climate-related stressors, which will have major implications for the structure and functioning of coastal ecosystems. However, kelp-dominated habitats along much of the NE Atlantic coastline have been chronically understudied over recent decades in comparison with other regions such as Australasia and North America. The paucity of field-based research currently impedes our ability to conserve and manage these important ecosystems. Targeted observational and experimental research conducted over large spatial and temporal scales is urgently needed to address these knowledge gaps.},

abstract = {The morphology and shape of algae can affect their survival in wave-swept environments because of the hydrodynamic drag created by water flow. Studies of morphology and drag are typically conducted at relatively low water velocities, and the influence of algal morphology on drag, over the range of water velocities algae must cope with in their natural environment, remains unclear. Here, we tested the link between morphological variation and hydrodynamic drag for a dominant kelp with complex morphology (Ecklonia radiata), over a range of water velocities representative of conditions on wave-swept reefs. Our results indicated that kelps on subtidal reefs must withstand maximal orbital water velocities in excess of 2–3 m s-1. Our measurements of drag, resulting from flows ranging from 1 to 3 m s-1, revealed that shape- and width-related thallus and lamina characters were important to drag at low speed, but that total thallus area (or biomass) was the main determinant of drag at high flow. Drag coefficients converged at increasing speed suggesting that, at high flow, significant thallus reconfiguration (more streamlined shape) decoupled drag from morphology. This implies that, at peak velocities, only size (total area), not morphology, is important to drag and the probability of dislodgment.},

abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt's calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt's outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.},

Here we show, for the first time ever, that microplastics have indeed reached the most remote of marine environments: the deep sea. We found plastic particles sized in the micrometre range in deep-sea sediments collected at four locations representing different deep-sea habitats ranging in depth from 1100 to 5000 m. Our results demonstrate that microplastic pollution has spread throughout the world's seas and oceans, into the remote and largely unknown deep sea.},

Forest distribution and proportional covers were predicted using water depth, light availability, wave exposure and sediment dynamics. The biomass of individual kelp species was modeled by supplementing these same variables with measures of seafloor slope and benthic position. Biomass predictions for Laminaria digitata and Laminaria hyperborea contrast the physiological tolerances of these species to light and wave exposure gradients. As a direct management output, we produced high-resolution maps (25 m2 grids) that closely match independent field data and provide vital information for marine spatial planning.},

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6 degrees C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.},

Through field sampling, we identified several sea urchin predators and investigated their predation rates on recently settled S. droebachiensis in laboratory experiments. Tethering experiments in kelp forest and on barren ground study sites in the area where sea urchin populations are collapsing confirmed predation by some of the predators tested in laboratory experiments. The edible crab Cancer pagurus was the most efficient sea urchin predator, and it was more abundant at kelp forest sites than on barren grounds. Stocks of C. pagurus have increased dramatically in central Norway since the 1990s, and predation by C. pagurus may contribute to the decline in sea urchin densities, allowing kelp recovery and conferring resilience of the new kelp forest state.},

A quick-view assessment appears at the beginning of each section, is colour-coded for ease of reference, and provides an indication of stock status and fishing pressure. The first line indicates the present status of the resource, which is the result of different pressures, such as fishing and environmental fluctuations, and past management practices. The second measure indicates the present level of fishing pressure exerted on that resource. The aim of sustainable management is to have resources that are in an optimal state and that are fished at optimal levels. However, historical over-fishing may have reduced some stocks to depleted or heavily depleted levels, and rebuilding these stocks could be attempted by reducing fishing pressure. Such re- building can take several years or even decades as the rate of recovery is dependent both on the biology of the species concerned and on natural recruitment fluctuations. Additionally, short-lived species (e.g. anchovy and squid) typically show high levels of recruitment variability that can result in substantial inter-annual fluctuations in population size; these could lead to the status of that resource changing from being depleted in one year to being optimal in the next. Five categories are defined for stock status, ranging from ‘Abundant' though to ‘Heavily depleted', and including an ‘Unknown' category for which there are insufficient or con- flicting data to enable an accurate estimate to be made. Four categories of fishing pressure are defined, from ‘Light' though‘ Optimal' to ‘Heavy', and again including an ‘Unknown' category for data-poor resources. The},

abstract = {Stereo Baited Remote Underwater Video systems (BRUVs) provide a quantitative sampling method for assessing mobile fauna in a range of habitat types and environments. This non-destructive and cost-effective technique is increasingly used for assessing estuarine, coastal and marine fauna. Although single camera systems have been used to assess the relative abundance (Nmax) of marine fish and invertebrates in low visibility North Atlantic near shore and coastal waters, stereo systems remain in their infancy within such environments and their use requires validation. Stereo systems that measure fish and invertebrate size enable size-frequency analysis of populations, providing critical information about life history and population status. We investigated the performance and efficacy of stereo BRUV systems within Welsh shallow coastal waters to test the effectiveness of this method. Data are presented on the capacity of the system to measure fish and invertebrate size under the constraints of low visibility ({\textless}2m). We also present data on the required duration of deployment required to effectively sample relative fish abundance and diversity. Our study recorded 19 species of mobile fauna with species-time accumulation curves providing evidence that a minimum deployment time of 1h is required to sample 66{\%} of the fish species, and 2h to sample 83{\%}. Results suggest that the efficiency of surveys for target species (e.g. gadoids) could be maximised by modifying the sampling duration between 1h and 2h. The study also demonstrates that measurements of fish and invertebrate length could be taken on 41{\%} of individuals (of those counted in relative abundance measures using Nmax), a statistic that varies between species. This indicates a need to modify the construction of the equipment for improved fish assemblage size frequency analysis. This is particularly relevant in areas and habitats where seine netting and trawling are not possible. We describe how the system can be modified for optimised usage within low visibility waters and suggest potential uses of the system.},

Game- tophytes from warm, intermediate and cool biogeographic regions were cultured over a tempera- ture gradient from 12 to 26°C, revealing optimum temperatures of {\~{}}18 to 23°C—well above current maximum temperatures in parts of the range—and a positive relationship between in situ temperature and thermal optima for performance. Optimum temperatures in warmer regions were more than 1°C higher than in cooler regions. Biogeographically, the thermal optima for gametophytes were more strongly linked to long-term temperature characteristics of a region (annual extremes, 3 yr range) than short-term variation (mean for the month prior) in sea temper- ature. These results document that present-day populations of E. radiata have adjusted their gametophyte thermal sensitivity according to their local environment, and further indicate that these differences are adaptive rather than phenotypic. Collectively, these findings suggest that the scope for thermal adaptation and gametophyte performance of E. radiata across most of its Australian distribution is within projected levels of future warming.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) and sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) in the NE Atlantic are highly related to physical factors and to temporal changes in temperature. On a large scale, we identified borders for kelp recovery and sea urchin persistence along the north-south gradient. Sea urchin persistence was also related to the coast-ocean gradient. The southern border corresponds to summer temperatures exceeding about 10°C, a threshold value known to be critical for sea urchin recruitment and development. The outer border along the coast-ocean gradient is related to temperature, wave exposure and salinity. On a finer scale, kelp recovery occurs mainly at ridges in outer, wave exposed, saline and warm areas whereas sea urchins still dominate in inner, shallow and cold areas, particularly in areas with optimal current speed for sea urchin foraging. In contrast to other studies in Europe, we here show a positive influence of climate change to presence of a long-lived climax canopy-forming kelp. The extent of the coast-ocean gradient varies within the study area, and is especially wide in the southern part where the presence of islands and skerries increases the area of the shallow coastal zone. This creates a large area with intermediate physical conditions for the two species and a mosaic of kelp and sea urchin dominated patches. The statistical models (GAM and BRT) show high performance and indicate recovery of kelp in 45-60{\%} of the study area. The study shows the value of combining a traditional (GAM) and a more complex (BRT) modeling approach to gain insight into complex spatial patterns of species or habitats. The results, methods and approaches are of general ecological relevance regardless of ecosystems and species, although they are particularly relevant for understanding and exploring the corresponding changes between algae and grazers in different coastal areas.},

abstract = {Recently, research examining the occurrence of microplastics in the marine environment has substantially increased. Field and laboratory work regularly provide new evidence on the fate of microplastic debris. This debris has been observed within every marine habitat. In this study, at least 101 peer-reviewed papers investigating microplastic pollution were critically analysed (Supplementary material). Microplastics are commonly studied in relation to (1) plankton samples, (2) sandy and muddy sediments, (3) vertebrate and invertebrate ingestion, and (4) chemical pollutant interactions. All of the marine organism groups are at an eminent risk of interacting with microplastics according to the available literature. Dozens of works on other relevant issues (i.e., polymer decay at sea, new sampling and laboratory methods, emerging sources, externalities) were also analysed and discussed. This paper provides the first in-depth exploration of the effects of microplastics on the marine environment and biota. The number of scientific publications will increase in response to present and projected plastic uses and discard patterns. Therefore, new themes and important approaches for future work are proposed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lindfield2014,
abstract = {* Underwater visual census (UVC) using SCUBA is a commonly used method for assessing reef fish communities. Evidence suggests, however, that fish avoid divers due to the sound of bubbles produced by open-circuit SCUBA, and avoidance behaviour is more pronounced as fishing pressure increases. Despite the potential for producing biased counts and conclusions, these behavioural effects have rarely been quantified, especially when assessing the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs). * To test the magnitude of avoidance behaviour, we surveyed fish populations inside and outside two MPAs in Guam, using two diving systems: standard open-circuit (OC) SCUBA and a closed-circuit rebreather (CCR) that produces no bubbles. Data were collected using a diver-operated stereo-video system (stereo-DOV), which provided counts of relative abundance, measures of fish length and the minimum approach distance of the diver to a fish. * Inside MPAs, fish surveys conducted with CCR recorded similar community metrics to fish surveys conducted with conventional OC SCUBA. In contrast, outside the MPAs, the bubble-free diving system recorded 48{\%} more species and up to 260{\%} greater fish abundance. These differences reflected the ability of a diver wearing the silent CCR unit to sample the larger, most heavily targeted species that are shy of divers in fished areas. This difference was also large enough to change some results from ‘reject' to ‘accept' the null hypothesis of ‘no significant differences exist between fished and protected areas'. * The use of CCR for fish surveys clearly minimizes behavioural biases associated with fish avoiding open-circuit SCUBA divers. We recommend the use of this bubble-free diving system for surveys assessing reef fish populations, especially in areas where fish are heavily targeted by spearfishing. If fish behaviour is not accounted for, surveys using SCUBA could result in erroneous conclusions when comparing fished and protected areas. While the behaviour of fish towards divers is rarely mentioned in conclusions from studies using UVC, it is an important source of bias that should be acknowledged and minimized where possible.},

abstract = {We present findings from two sets of measurements that quantified currents around and over the full extent of a giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forest located at Mohawk Reef, Santa Barbara, California. Velocities were damped inside this 200-m 3 300-m forest, but not to the extent reported for larger (kilometer-scale) kelp beds, suggesting that alongshore currents may play a greater role in exchange than has often been assumed. Secondary flow features that bear on the performance of forest organisms were observed, including a region along the forest's outer boundary where velocities exceeded incident speeds by up to 200{\%}. An offshore current on the order of 1 cm s21 developed within the kelp bed, likely due to pressure gradients established across the forest coupled with topography. Wake recirculations that might have facilitated leeward retention of waterborne subsidies were not apparent. Calculations suggest that kelp beds can interact with (and thus potentially filter) substantial portions of impinging waters; in our study, 40–90{\%} of arriving waters entered the upstream end, and 20–70{\%} reached the center of the forest. Seasonal changes in the size and density of the forest modified the levels of flow damping and filtration. The sum of these effects suggests potential influences on organisms throughout the forest community. 1839 Giant},

abstract = {We investigated patterns of genetic structure in two sister kelp species to explore how distribution width along the shore, zonation, latitudinal distribution and historical factors contribute to contrasting patterns of genetic diversity. We implemented a hierarchical sampling scheme to compare patterns of genetic diversity and structure in these two kelp species co-distributed along the coasts of Brittany (France) using a total of 12 microsatellites, nine for Laminaria hyperborea and 11 for Laminaria digitata, of which eight amplified in both species. The genetic diversity and connectivity of L. hyperborea populations were greater than those of L. digitata populations in accordance with the larger cross-shore distribution width along the coast and the greater depth occupied by L. hyperborea populations in contrast to L. digitata populations. In addition, marginal populations showed reduced genetic diversity and connectivity, which erased isolation-by-distance patterns in both species. As L. digitata encounters its southern range limit in southern Brittany (SBr) while L. hyperborea extends down to mid-Portugal, it was possible to distinguish the effect of habitat continuity from range edge effects. We found that L. digitata did not harbour high regional diversity at its southern edge, as expected in a typical rear edge, suggesting that refuges from the last glacial maximum for L. digitata were probably not located in SBr, but most likely further north. For both species, the highest levels of genetic diversity were found in the Iroise Sea and Morlaix Bay, the two regions in which they are being currently harvested. Preserving genetic diversity of these two foundation species in these areas should, thus, be a priority for the management of this resource in Brittany.},

abstract = {Wave exposure is one of the main structuring forces in the marine environment. Methods that enable large scale quantification of environmental variables have become increasingly important for predicting marine communities in the context of spatial planning and coastal zone management. Existing methods range from cartographic solutions to numerical hydrodynamic simulations, and differ in the scale and spatial coverage of their outputs. Using a biological exposure index we compared the performance of four wave exposure models ranging from simple to more advanced techniques. All models were found to be related to the biological exposure index and their performance, measured as bootstrapped R2distributions, overlapped. Qualitatively, there were differences in the spatial patterns indicating higher complexity with more advanced techniques. In order to create complex spatial patterns wave exposure models should include diffraction, especially in coastal areas rich in islands. The inclusion of wind strength and frequency, in addition to wind direction and bathymetry, further tended to increase the amount of explained variation. The large potential of high-resolution numerical models to explain the observed patterns of species distribution in complex coastal areas provide exciting opportunities for future research. Easy access to relevant wave exposure models will aid large scale habitat classification systems and the continuously growing field of marine species distribution modelling, ultimately serving marine spatial management and planning. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We tested the ability of juvenile sporophytes of two coexisting kelps native to Portugal, Laminaria ochroleuca and Saccorhiza polyschides, to adjust their photosynthesis and respiration to increasing sea water temperatures. These responses were measured for S. polyschides from both the subtidal and the intertidal habitat, and for L. ochroleuca from the intertidal habitat. L. ochroleuca showed a reduced ability to acclimatize to changing conditions, whereas S. polyschides demonstrated a larger physiological flexibility. These findings are connected with the life-history traits of these species. Additionally, optimum temperatures for the primary production of kelps were assessed, indicating higher values for inter- than subtidal S. polyschides. Significant physiological differences between inter- and subtidal S. polyschides were observed, based on metabolic rates of primary production and dark respiration. This study suggests that, under a warming climate scenario, responses can significantly vary for each species, and that L. ochroleuca is more susceptible to ocean warming than S. polyschides, due to larger acclimatization capacity of the latter. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {As global warming continues over the coming century, marine organisms will experience a warmer, more acidic ocean. Although these stressors may behave antagonistically or synergistically and will impact organisms both directly (i.e., physiologically) and indirectly (i.e., through altered species interactions), few studies have examined the complexities of these effects in combination. To address these uncertainties, we examined the independent and combined effects of el- evated temperature and pCO2 on the physiology of the adult sporophyte stage of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the grazing of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. While elevating pCO2 alone had no effect on M. pyrifera growth or photosynthetic carbon uptake, elevating temperature alone resulted in a significant reduction in both. How- ever, when M. pyrifera was grown under elevated temperature and pCO2 together, growth and photosynthetic carbon up- take significantly increased relative to ambient conditions, suggesting an interaction of these factors on photosynthetic physiology. S. purpuratus held under future conditions generally exhibited reduced growth, and smaller gonads than urchins held under present-day conditions. However, urchins fed kelp grown under future conditions showed higher growth rates, partially ameliorating this effect. Feeding rates were variable over the course of the experiment, with only the first feeding rate experiment showing significantly lower rates for urchins held under future conditions. Together, these data suggest that M. pyrifera may benefit physiologically from a warmer, more acidic (i.e., higher pCO2 ) ocean while S. purpuratus will likely be impacted negatively. Given that kelp-urchin interactions can be important to kelp forest struc- ture, changes to either of these populations may have serious consequences for many coastal environments.},

abstract = {* Water temperatures off the south-western coast of Western Australia rose to unprecedented levels during February and March 2011, and this warming event has been termed a “marine heat wave”. While surface temperatures were more than 3°C above the long-term monthly average over an extended area in February 2011, the temperature in some localised areas in coastal waters exceeded the long-term monthly average by 5°C for periods of a day or two in late February/early March. * A scientific Workshop was organised on Thursday 5 May, 2011 to review the oceanic processes and biological/fisheries consequences of the heat wave and to provide a means for capturing much of the anecdotal information. * This heat wave, which coincided with an extremely strong La Ni{\~{n}}a event and a record strength Leeuwin Current, is viewed as a major temperature anomaly superimposed on the underlying long-term ocean-warming trend. * While sudden changes in water temperature have been recorded in waters off the Western Australian coast in the past, there have been no previous records of such strongly elevated temperatures. * Biological effects reported to date include fish and invertebrate deaths, extensions and contractions in species distributions, variations in recruitment and growth-rates, impacts on trophic relationships and community structure, and variations in catch rates of exploited species. * As such, the elevated water temperatures were viewed as resulting either in mortality or in a variety of “sub-lethal” effects, both of which can have either short or long-term implications. * These observed and expected biological consequences are based primarily on anecdotal information collected during or directly after the passage of the heat wave. However, as results from ongoing research and monitoring programs become available, a more comprehensive and considered view of the effects will be forthcoming in the form of peer-reviewed journal papers. * While widespread mortality of fish and invertebrates were reported, none were shown to be attributable to disease. * It appears that the incursions of large volumes of silt-laden water from river outflows into the adjacent coastal waters of the mid-west coast between Dongara and NW Cape following the passage of the tropical cyclone Bianca in late January are also likely to have contributed to the mortality experienced by the marine biota of that region. * While the nature of the impacts will to a large extent dictate the type and degree of management response, most of the fishery responses identified in this report are currently covered in the ongoing monitoring and assessment protocols in place in the Department of Fisheries, noting that in particular, the response to mortality events is a well co-ordinated, interdepartmental process. * The two most urgent “Fisheries Management” actions are (a) the need to review the management (and future monitoring) arrangements for Area 8 of the Roe's abalone fishery, and (b) to determine the consequences of any additional mortality of the 2010 rock lobster puerulus settlement.},

abstract = {In 1990, Andrew Bakun proposed that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations would force intensification of upwelling-favorable winds in eastern boundary current systems that contribute substantial services to society. Because there is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind trends support Bakun's hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind intensification. The preponderance of published analyses suggests that winds have intensified in the California, Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes, consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change.

abstract = {Net primary production (NPP) is influenced by disturbance-driven fluctuations in foliar standing crop (FSC) and resource-driven fluctuations in rates of recruitment and growth, yet most studies of NPP have focused primarily on factors influencing growth. We quantified NPP, FSC, recruitment, and growth rate for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, at three kelp forests in southern California, U.S.A., over a 54-month period and determined the relative roles of FSC, recruitment, and growth rate in contributing to variation in annual NPP. Net primary production averaged between 0.42 and 2.38 kg dry mass x m(-2) x yr(-1) at the three sites. The initial FSC present at the beginning of the growth year and the recruitment of new plants during the year explained 63{\%} and 21{\%} of the interannual variation observed in NPP, respectively. The previous year's NPP and disturbance from waves collectively accounted for 80{\%} of the interannual variation in initial FSC. No correlation was found between annual growth rate (i.e., the amount of new kelp mass produced per unit of existing kelp mass) and annual NPP (i.e., the amount of new kelp mass produced per unit area of ocean bottom), largely because annual growth rate was consistent compared to initial FSC and recruitment, which fluctuated greatly among years and sites. Although growth rate was a poor predictor of variation in annual NPP, it was principally responsible for the high mean values observed for NPP by Macrocystis. These high mean values reflected rapid growth (average of approximately 2{\%} per day) of a relatively small standing crop (maximum annual mean = 444 g dry mass/m2) that replaced itself approximately seven times per year. Disturbance-driven variability in FSC may be generally important in explaining variation in NPP, yet it is rarely examined because cycles of disturbance and recovery occur over timescales of decades or more in many systems. Considerable insight into how variation in FSC drives variation in NPP may be gained by studying systems such as giant kelp forests that are characterized by frequent disturbance and rapid rates of growth and recruitment.},

abstract = {Assessing the vulnerability to storm surges requires amongst other things to identify the degree of coastal exposure to active waves. This paper proposes an integrated analytical approach that involves: 1) the degree of coastal exposure to different wave directions of incidence, 2) the extent of human structures at risk, and 3) the maximum wave height determination for each identified direction based on local wave climate analysis. It contributes to the development of a method for assessing vulnerability of existing built coastal assets to storm surge damages. Results provide a diagnostic of constructions' vulnerability, which is essential for adaptation and mitigation planning. This approachwas applied to beaches of SantaCatarina Island on the Brazilian southern coast. The northeast wave direction endangers most of the area due to the existing occupation pattern close to the sea toward that quadrant. Extreme events are more frequently associated with south and southeastwave directions. Integrating all variables, northeast wave direction was confirmed as the most dangerous in the area, followed by southern, eastern and southeastern directions, respectively. These results differ from usual estimations that tend to consider the most frequent wave directions and higher intensities, without considering the potentially affected developed surfaces.},

abstract = {Obtaining synoptic observations of dynamic ocean phenomena such as fronts, eddies, oxygen minimum zones and blooms has been challenging primarily due to the large spatial scales involved. Traditional methods of ob- servation with manned ships are expensive and, unless the vessel can survey at high-speed, unrealistic. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robotic platforms that have been making steady gains in sampling capabilities and impacting oceanographic observations especially in coastal areas. However, their reach is still limited by operating constraints related to their energy sources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently introduced in coastal and polar oceanographic experiments have added to the mix in observation strategy and methods. They offer a tantalizing opportunity to bridge such scales in operational oceanog- raphy by coordinating with AUVs in the water-column to get in-situ measurements. In this paper, we articulate the principal challenges in operating UAVs with AUVs making synoptic observations for such targeted water- column sampling. We do so in the context of autonomous control and operation for networked robotics and describe novel experiments while articulating the key challenges and lessons learned.},

abstract = {Species are the unit of analysis in many global change and conservation biology studies; however, species are not uniform entities but are composed of different, sometimes locally adapted, popula-tions differing in plasticity. We examined how intraspecific variation in thermal niches and pheno-typic plasticity will affect species distributions in a warming climate. We first developed a conceptual model linking plasticity and niche breadth, providing five alternative intraspecific sce-narios that are consistent with existing literature. Secondly, we used ecological niche-modeling techniques to quantify the impact of each intraspecific scenario on the distribution of a virtual species across a geographically realistic setting. Finally, we performed an analogous modeling exercise using real data on the climatic niches of different tree provenances. We show that when population differentiation is accounted for and dispersal is restricted, forecasts of species range shifts under climate change are even more pessimistic than those using the conventional assump-tion of homogeneously high plasticity across a species' range. Suitable population-level data are not available for most species so identifying general patterns of population differentiation could fill this gap. However, the literature review revealed contrasting patterns among species, urging greater levels of integration among empirical, modeling and theoretical research on intraspecific phenotypic variation.},

Landscape effects on are even less understood in marine genetic connectivity populations, where habitat mapping is particularly challenging. In this study, we model spatial genetic structure of a habitat structuring species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, using highly variable microsatellite markers. GIS mapping was used to characterize habitat and distance between continuity sampling sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel, and their roles as predictors of genetic differentiation were evaluated. Mean dispersal distance (a) and effective population size (Ne) were estimated by comparing our IBD slope with those from simulations incorporating habitat continuity and spore dispersal characteristics of the study area. We found an allelic richness of 7-50 alleles/locus, which to our knowledge is the highest reported for macroalgae. The best regression model relating genetic distance to habitat variables included both geographic distance and habitat continuity, which were respectively, positively and negatively related to genetic distance. Our results provide strong support for a dependence of gene flow on both distance and habitat continuity and elucidate the combination of Ne and a that explained genetic differentiation.},

abstract = {Climate-driven changes in biotic interactions can profoundly alter ecological communities, particularly when they impact foundation species. In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to 'barrens' when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs.},

abstract = {Aim To assess environmental changes within a marine biogeographical transition zone and how they have affected seaweed assemblages and distributions over the past two decades. Location Brittany (western France, Europe) – a biogeographical transition zone between cold-temperate and warm-temperate regions. Methods We assessed spatio-temporal variation for three environmental parameters [sea-surface temperature (SST), suspended inorganic matter and chlorophyll a] between 1992 and 2012 in five adjoining regions using generalized linear models. To investigate changes in assemblages and distributional patterns of red seaweeds based on sampling surveys conducted during two separate periods (1992–1998 and 2010–2012), we used two complementary approaches, multivariate data analysis and species distribution models (SDMs) with a set of modelling procedures. Results Coastal water temperature in Brittany has increased by 0.7 °C on average over the past two decades (0.35 °C per decade). At a finer scale, changes in SST showed that Brittany constitutes a mosaic of contrasting conditions, with the western and north-western regions being colder and less affected by climate change than the other three regions. Our results suggest that increasing SST caused significant changes in subtidal red seaweed assemblages over the 20-year period. Between the two periods, SDMs predicted significant species shifts for seven out of ten representative species, and reductions in the distribution ranges of most species. Main conclusions Our study confirmed important differences across the different regions of the studied biogeographical transition zone. Changes in abiotic parameters and red seaweed assemblages are expected to occur at varying extremes across these regions, with western and north-western Brittany representing the most stable zones that might constitute a potential refuge for certain species when responding to global changes.},

abstract = {West African small-scale fisheries are analyzed to determine their contribution to the economy, food security (catches and employment) and poverty alleviation (income and choice of activity). Previous quantitative analysis revealed major discrepancies between official data (which essentially underreports artisanal and ignores subsistence fisheries catches) and re-estimated data obtained from various reports. This resulted in a doubling of the landed value of small-scale fisheries catches to 3.5 billion USD year{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} compared to officially reported numbers. Similarly, employment estimated officially at 1 million fishers was found here to be only 70{\%} higher when subsistence fisheries are included. For the 22 West African countries considered in this study, we estimate that 6.7 million people directly depend on fishing activities for their food and/or livelihood. Furthermore, the present study shows an increasing reliance of West Africa's coastal population on fisheries for their food and income despite decreasing total income and increasing fishing costs, which in turn aggravated poverty. The notion that small-scale fisheries could contribute to poverty alleviation despite crises and shocks is thus highly contestable. Indeed, although the number of people depending on fisheries is still increasing, driven by their current (even though decreasing) profitability, the perception of small-scale fishing as an activity of last resort is probably justified, and more appropriate than viewing it as a source of sustainable livelihood.},

abstract = {Overfishing and human-induced climate change are putting severe pressure onmarine ecosystems. In the south- ern Benguela, most of South Africa's commercial fisheries have a long history of exploitation and this, coupled with spatio-temporal changes in key species over the last three decades has severely impacted some of South Africa's fisheries and ecosystems. This reviewsummarizes these spatio-temporal changes and investigates possi- ble drivers thereof. It incorporates both past and current research,with a large portion of the latterhaving formed part of the University of Cape Town's Ma-Re BASICS (Marine Research in the Benguela and Agulhas Systems for supporting Interdisciplinary Climate-change Science) 2010–2013 program. Almost all described changes involve a temporal decline or a spatial shift in species. Fishing seems to have played a role in many of the observed stock declines, for example through geographically disproportionate catches in relation to stock distribution. In some cases, changes in the physical environment seem to have played an additional role, e.g., rock lobsters on the west coast have been affected by fishing as well as changes in the physical environment. In almost all cases these changes have taken place since the 1980s/1990s, except for one or two resources,which have experienced declines since at least themid20thcentury. Spatial shifts inspecieshave either involvedaneastward expansionof cool-water species, includingkelps, rock lobster and pelagicfish, or a retractionofwarm-water species suchas the brownmussel, suggesting a cooling of inshorewaters along the south-west coast since the 1980s. This suggested cooling is revealed in ocean temperature (SST Pathfinder),wind and upwelling data for the Cape Peninsula and south-west coast region during the same period. The absence or inconsistency of long-termdata is problematic when trying to identify drivers of ecosystemchange, and actual ecosystemchange itself. We discuss this using ocean temperature in the southern Benguela as an example. In addition, the complex interplay between climate and anthropogenic (notably fishing) drivers makes identification of drivers difficult and disentangling these combined effectswill require interdisciplinary collaboration, co-ordinated ecosystem projects, increased model- ling effort and the continuation, but also establishment, of new, long-termmonitoring studies. {\textcopyright}},

Together, these countries captured approximately 98{\%} of global landings in 2005. The cost data is categorized into country and gear type combinations, and this structure allows the cost data to link to spatially defined catch database for future analysis in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

abstract = {The IPCC AR5 provided an overview of the likely effects of climate change on Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS), stimulating increased interest in research examining the issue. We use these recent studies to develop a new synthesis describing climate change impacts on EBUS. We find that model and observational data suggest coastal upwelling-favorable winds in poleward portions of EBUS have intensified and will continue to do so in the future. Although evidence is weak in data that are presently available, future projections show that this pattern might be driven by changes in the positioning of the oceanic high-pressure systems rather than by deepening of the continental low-pressure systems, as previously proposed. There is low confidence regarding the future effects of climate change on coastal temperatures and biogeochemistry due to uncertainty in the countervailing responses to increasing upwelling and coastal warming, the latter of which could increase thermal stratification and render upwelling less effective in lifting nutrient-rich deep waters into the photic zone. Although predictions of ecosystem responses are uncertain, EBUS experience considerable natural variability and may be inherently resilient. However, multi-trophic level, end-to-end (i.e., "winds to whales") studies are needed to resolve the resilience of EBUS to climate change, especially their response to long-term trends or extremes that exceed pre-industrial ranges.},

abstract = {Species interactions are integral drivers of community structure and can change from competitive to facilitative with increasing environmental stress. In subtidal marine ecosystems, however, inter- actions along physical stress gradients have seldom been tested. We observed seaweed canopy interactions across depth and latitudinal gradients to test whether light and temperature stress structured interaction patterns. We also quantified interspecific and intraspecific interactions among nine subtidal canopy seaweed species across three continents to examine the general nature of interactions in subtidal systems under low consumer pressure. We reveal that positive and neu- tral interactions are widespread throughout global seaweed communities and the nature of interac- tions can change from competitive to facilitative with increasing light stress in shallow marine systems. These findings provide support for the stress gradient hypothesis within subtidal seaweed communities and highlight the importance of canopy interactions for the maintenance of subtidal marine habitats experiencing environmental stress.},

abstract = {Past climate-driven range shifts shaped intraspecific diversities of species world-wide. Earlier studies, focused on glacial refugia, might have overlooked genetic erosion at lower latitudes associated with warmer periods. For marine species able to colonize deeper waters, depth shifts might be important for local persistence, preventing some latitudinal shifts, analogous to elevational refugia in terrestrial habitats. In this study, we asked whether past latitudinal or depth range shifts explain extant gene pools in Saccorhiza polyschides, a large habitat structuring brown alga distributed from coastal to offshore deep reefs. North-east Atlantic and western Mediterranean basin. Genetic structure and diversity were inferred using seven microsatel- lite loci, for 27 sites throughout the entire distributional range. Ecological niche modelling (ENM) was performed with and without information about genetic structure (sub-taxon niche structure) to predict distributions for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the warmer Mid-Holocene (MH) and the present. Both ENM approaches predicted a wider potential distribution in dee- per waters than is presently known, a post-glacial expansion to northern shores and the extirpation of southern edges during the warmer MH. Genetic data corroborated range dynamics, revealing three major genetic groups with cur- rent boundaries in the Bay of Biscay and the Lisbon coastal region, pinpointing ancient refugial origins. Despite extensive southern range contraction, the southernmost warmer regions are still the richest in genetic diversity, indicating long-term persistence of large populations. ENMs suggested that this could only have been possible due to stable refugia in deeper reefs. The global distribution of gene pools of temperate marine forests is explained by past range shifts that structured both latitudinal glacial refugia and depth refugia during warmer periods. Deep rear edge populations play a fundamental role during periods of extreme climate, allowing persistence and retaining some of the largest genetic diversity pools of the species' distri- bution.},

abstract = {Molecular ecology has moved beyond the use of a relatively small number of markers, often noncoding, and it is now possible to use whole-genome measures of gene expression with microarrays and RNAseq (i.e. transcriptomics) to capture molecular response to environmental challenges. While transcriptome studies are shedding light on the mechanistic basis of traits as complex as personality or physiological response to catastrophic events, these approaches are still challenging because of the required technical expertise, difficulties with analysis and cost. Still, we found that in the last 10 years, 575 studies used microarrays or RNAseq in ecology. These studies broadly address three questions that reflect the progression of the field: (i) How much variation in gene expression is there and how is it structured? (ii) How do environmental stimuli affect gene expression? (iii) How does gene expression affect phenotype? We discuss technical aspects of RNAseq and microarray technology, and a framework that leverages the advantages of both. Further, we highlight future directions of research, particularly related to moving beyond correlation and the development of additional annotation resources. Measuring gene expression across an array of taxa in ecological settings promises to enrich our understanding of ecology and genome function.},

abstract = {Similar environmental driving forces can produce similarity among geographically distant ecosystems. Coastal oceanic upwelling, for example, has been associated with elevated biomass and abundance patterns of certain functional groups, e.g., corticated macroalgae. In the upwelling system of Northern Chile, we examined measures of intertidal macro- benthic composition, structure and trophic ecology across eighteen shores varying in their proximity to two coastal upwelling centres, in a hierarchical sampling design (spatial scales of {\textgreater}1 and {\textgreater}10 km). The influence of coastal upwelling on intertidal communities was con- firmed by the stable isotope values ($\delta$13C and $\delta$15N) of consumers, including a dominant suspension feeder, grazers, and their putative resources of POM, epilithic biofilm, and macroalgae.We highlight the utility of muscle $\delta$15N from the suspension feeding mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, as a proxy for upwelling, supported by satellite data and previous studies. Where possible, we used corrections for broader-scale trends, spatial autocorrela- tion, ontogenetic dietary shifts and spatial baseline isotopic variation prior to analysis. Our results showed macroalgal assemblage composition, and benthic consumer assemblage structure, varied significantly with the intertidal influence of coastal upwelling, especially contrasting bays and coastal headlands. Coastal topography also separated differences in consumer resource use. This suggested that coastal upwelling, itself driven by coastline topography, influences intertidal communities by advecting nearshore phytoplankton popu- lations offshore and cooling coastal water temperatures.We recommend the isotopic val- ues of benthic organisms, specifically long-lived suspension feeders, as in situ alternatives to offshore measurements of upwelling influence.},

abstract = {Assessing effects of herbivory across broad gradients of varying ocean climate conditions and over small spatial scales is crucial for understanding its influence on primary producers. Effects of herbivory on the distribution and abundance of kelp recruits were examined experimentally at two regions under contrasting ocean climate. Specifically, the abundance and survivorship of kelp recruits and the abundance of macro-herbivores were compared between a ‘cool' and a ‘warm' region in northern and central Portugal, respectively. In each region, the abundance of kelp recruits and the intensity of grazing were compared between habitats of different topography within reefs (open reef vs. crevices). Compared to the ‘warm' region, the abundance of kelp recruits was 3.9 times greater in the ‘cool' region, where 85{\%} of recruits were found in open reef habitats. In contrast, 87{\%} of recruits in the ‘warm' region were restricted to crevices. The ‘warm' region had 140 times greater abundances of sea urchins, 45 times more herbivorous fish and 4.1 times more grazing marks on kelp recruits than the ‘cool' region. Grazing assays showed ca. 50 times higher rates of kelp biomass consumption, mainly by fishes, and zero survivorship of kelp recruits in the ‘warm' relative to the ‘cool' region. This study suggests both temperature and herbivores affect abundances of kelp recruits across latitudes, and demonstrates how herbivores affect their distribution at local scales, driving kelp recruits into ‘hiding' in crevices under intense herbivory. Consequently, where net recruitment success is compromised by herbivory, the persistence of kelps will be contingent on availability of topographical refuges.},

abstract = {Aim Coastal marine environments experience a wide range of biotic and abiotic forces that can limit and punctuate the geographical range and abundance of species through time. Determining the relative strengths and nonlinear effects of these processes is vital to understanding the biogeographical structures of species. There has been an ongoing discussion concerning the relative importance of these processes in controlling the dynamics of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, an important structure-forming species on shallow reefs in the eastern Pacific. We used novel spatial time-series that span nearly three decades to determine the dominant drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass and the temporal and spatial scales over which they operate across the dominant range of the giant kelp in North America. Location Near-shore areas from A{\~{n}}o Nuevo, California, to the USA/Mexico border. Methods We employed empirical orthogonal functions to elucidate the primary drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass across space and time and then fit generalized additive and linear models to determine the nonlinear effect and relative importance of each of these potential drivers along the c. 1500-km study region over a 25-year period. Results Wave disturbance, nitrate availability and the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation were the most important environmental predictors of giant kelp canopy biomass, explaining 24.5{\%}, 12.7{\%} and 6.1{\%} of the variance, respectively. Environmental drivers of canopy biomass exhibited profound spatial differences in relative effect sizes. Nonlinear effect shapes of each potential biomass driver were determined, which explained these spatial differences. Main conclusions These large-scale analyses help to reconcile the local-scale conclusions of canopy biomass dynamics across the California coastline and show that these dynamics differ predictably in space and time in accordance with local and regional differences in environmental drivers. By characterizing the nonlinear effects of these drivers, we identified spatio-temporal patterns of processes that cannot be detected by remote sensing.},

abstract = {Aim This study examines beach-cast rafts of Durvillaea antarctica (bull kelp) along New Zealand's east coast to determine spatial variation in beach-cast haplotype assemblages. By using genetic markers, the geographical origins of rafted D. antarctica samples can be determined, allowing for the examination of dispersal pathways, distances rafted, and potential barriers to dispersal. Location An approximately 1000 km stretch of New Zealand's eastern coastline. Methods 686 samples of beach-cast D. antarctica rafts were collected and sequenced for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 in order to infer geographical origins and dispersal dynamics of rafted specimens. Results were examined using principal components analysis (PCA) in order to determine spatial groupings. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was used to determine statistical support for the detected spatial groups. Results Hierarchical AMOVA revealed three major regional genetic assemblages, which probably reflect broad oceanographic features. In particular, the north–south genetic partitioning in rafted kelp assemblages either side of the Cape Campbell region in central New Zealand closely corresponds to an oceanographically mediated disjunction previously observed in a number of larval-dispersed marine invertebrate taxa. Main conclusions Findings from this study suggest that passively drifting kelp rafts and planktonic invertebrate larvae may be similarly constrained by oceanographic features, and demonstrate how the phylogenetic structure present in populations of D. antarctica provide a framework with which to map dispersal patterns.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Klemas, V.V., 2015. Coastal and environmental remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles: An overview. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a viable alternative to conventional platforms for acquiring high-resolution remote-sensing data at lower cost and increased operational flexibility. UAVs include various configurations of unmanned aircraft, multirotor helicopters (e.g., quadcopters), and balloons/blimps of different sizes and shapes. Quadcopters and balloons fill a gap between satellites and aircraft when a stationary monitoring platform is needed for relatively long-term observation of an area. UAVs have advanced designs to carry small payloads and integrated flight control systems, giving them semiautonomous or fully autonomous flight capabilities. Miniaturized sensors are being developed/adapted for UAV payloads, including hyperspectral imagers, LIDAR, synthetic aperture radar, and thermal infrared sensors. UAVs are now used for a wide range of environmental applications, such as coast...},

abstract = {1. Kelp species are ecosystem engineers in temperate coasts, where they provide valuable ser- vices to humans. Evidence of the declines of kelp forests exists from several regions, but their effects on fisheries still need to be elucidated. More effective management strategies for sus- tainable fisheries require a synthesis of research findings and an assessment of how research could be improved to fill current gaps. 2. This review aimed to: (i) summarize the available evidence on the influence of changes in kelp density and/or area on the abundance and diversity of associated fisheries and (ii) exam- ine how research on kelp–fisheries interactions could better support effective management. 3. Most studies (67{\%}) reported data ascribable, directly or indirectly, to a positive relation- ship between kelp and fishery-relevant variables, 11{\%} provided evidence of a negative rela- tionship, 15{\%} indicated species-specific findings and the remaining found unclear or ‘neutral' relationships. 4. Important shortcomings were identified, including the paucity of experimental studies suit- able to test for unequivocal cause–effect relationships, the disproportion between North Amer- ica, which is well-studied, and other regions and between the large number of fish-based investigations and the small number of those focusing on other commercially important organ- isms, and the general lack of studies carried out over spatial and temporal scales comparable to those of global processes driving patterns of distribution of both kelps and fisheries. 5. Synthesis and applications. The consistency of most studies in showing a positive kelp–fish- ery relationship supports the protection of kelp habitats stated by current environmental directives. However, achieving their goals requires that the limitations we detect are addressed through better connections between research, management practice and policy. This would require the following: (i) researchers to combine multiple approaches (large-scale experimental studies and modelling) for the analysis of kelp–fisheries relationships; (ii) fund- ing agencies to provide resources needed to fill the existing gaps; and (iii) researchers and institutions from less studied regions to strengthen collaborations with those from regions where there have been more investigations into kelp–fishery systems. This is essential under present and predicted environmental changes, with the ultimate aim of conserving and allow- ing the sustainable use of critically important habitats and of fishery resources relying on these.

abstract = {To reveal potential impacts to environment and human health quantitatively, co-composting and utilization of sludge and woodchips were investigated using a life-cycle-based model, EASETECH. Three scenarios were assessed through experiments using different material ratios. Emission amounts during co-composting were determined by monitoring data and mass balance. With 100. t sludge treatment, co-composting showed impacts to acidification (29.9 PE) and terrestrial eutrophication (57.7 PE) mainly for ammonia emission. Compost utilization presented savings on freshwater eutrophication (-1.5 PE) because of phosphorus substitution. With the application of fewer woodchips, impacts to acidification and terrestrial eutrophication decreased because more ammonium was reserved rather than released. All impacts to human toxicity were not significant (8.2 ± 0.6 PE) because the compost was used for urban landscaping rather than farming. Trace gaseous compounds showed marginal impacts to global warming and toxicity categories. The results provide a new perspective and offer evidence for appropriate sludge treatment selection.},

The results from a computer simulation model show that the logarithm of Nm is approximately linearly related to the logarithm of the average frequency of private alleles, p( 1), in a sample of alleles from the population. It is shown that this result is relatively insensitive to changes in parameters of the model other than Nm and the number of individuals sampled per population. The dependence of the value of p(1) on the numbers of individuals sampled provides a rough way to correct for differences in sample size. This method was applied to data from 16 species, showing that estimated values of Nm range from much greater than I to less than 0.1. These results confirm the qualitative analysis of Slatkin (1981). This method was also applied to subsamples from a population to show how to measure the extent of isolation of local population},

abstract = {If ever there were “charismatic megaflora” of the sea, the Laminariales (kelp) would undoubtedly meet that designation. From the Northeast Pacific kelp forests to the less diverse, but nonetheless dense, kelp beds ranging from the Arctic to the cold temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere, kelp provide habitat structure and food for a variety of productive marine systems. Consequently, kelp are well represented in the literature, however, understanding their evolution has proven challenging. We used a 152-gene phylogenomics approach to better resolve the phylogeny of the “derived” kelp families (viz., Agaraceae, Alariaceae, Laminariaceae, and Lessoniaceae). The formerly unresolved Egregia menziesii firmly joined a significantly expanded Arthrothamnaceae including Arthrothamnus, Cymathaere, Ecklonia, Macrocystis, Nereocystis, Pelagophycus, Postelsia, Pseudolessonia, Saccharina, and Streptophyllopsis, which rendered both the Laminariaceae and Lessoniaceae monogeneric. A published eight-gene alignment, the most marker-rich prior to this study, was expanded and analyzed to facilitate inclusion of Aureophycus. Although the topology was unchanged at the family level between the transcriptome data set relative to eight-gene analyses, the superior resolving power of the former was clearly established.},

@article{Makwela2016,
abstract = {Introduction Surveys of the marine ichthyofauna associated with temperate reefs are challenging because, unlike soft sediment, these habitats cannot be surveyed with trawl gear (Sink et al. 2012). Reefs often harbour complex species assemblages, stratified according to physical and biological gradients (Ross {\&} Quattrini 2007; S{\"{o}}ffker, Sloman {\&} Hall-Spencer 2011). Survey methods for such habitats have mostly been confined to diver-based underwater visual census (UVC) for shallow depths ({\textless}30 m) (Assis et al. 2013) and traps, hooks and line fishing for deeper depths ({\textgreater}30 m) (S{\"{o}}ffker et al. 2011). Recently developed remote video-based methods have produced promising results (Cappo, Speare {\&} De'ath 2004; Stoner et al. 2008). Unlike stationary video sampling methods such as baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys (Cappo, Speare {\&} De'ath 2007), remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys, like diver-based UVC, allow for a comprehensive inspection of the sampling area and can also be used within a standardised sampling design in the form of transects or fixed, baited stationary deployments. Here we report on the first ROV dives to investigate the deep reef ichthyofauna and its associated habitats on the central Agulhas Bank. In addition to general habitat observations, we were interested in (1) fish behaviour towards a ROV, (2) deployment times sufficient to detect representative species assemblages and (3) the number of fish species detected relative to other surveys. Methods Study area The Agulhas Bank is the centre of abundance for a number of southern African warm temperate demersal reef species, many of which are endemic (Sink et al. 2012). Most of the hard substrate habitats of the Agulhas Bank remain poorly researched (G{\"{o}}tz et al. 2014; Smale et al. 1993). Background: Despite their ecological and economic importance, reef habitats on the central Agulhas Bank, off the southern tip of Africa, remain poorly studied. The ichthyofauna of these habitats cannot be surveyed using trawl gear.},

abstract = {Vegetated coastal habitats have been identified as important carbon sinks. In contrast to angiosperm-based habitats such as seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangroves, marine macroalgae have largely been excluded from discussions of marine carbon sinks. Macroalgae are the dominant primary producers in the coastal zone, but they typically do not grow in habitats that are considered to accumulate large stocks of organic carbon. However, the presence of macroalgal carbon in the deep sea and sediments, where it is effectively sequestered from the atmosphere, has been reported. A synthesis of these data suggests that macroalgae could represent an important source of the carbon sequestered in marine sediments and the deep ocean. We pro- pose two main modes for the transport of macroalgae to the deep ocean and sediments: macroalgal material drifting through submarine canyons, and the sinking of negatively buoyant macroalgal detritus. A rough estimate suggests that macroalgae could sequester about 173 TgC yr–1 (with a range of 61–268 TgC yr–1 ) globally. About 90{\%} of this sequestration occurs through export to the deep sea, and the rest through burial in coastal sediments. This estimate exceeds that for carbon sequestered in angiosperm-based coastal habitats.},

After decades of ocean warming, extreme marine heat waves forced a 100-kilometer range contraction of extensive kelp forests and saw temperate species replaced by seaweeds, invertebrates, corals, and fishes characteristic of subtropical and tropical waters. This community-wide tropicalization fundamentally altered key ecological processes, suppressing the recovery of kelp forests.},

abstract = {Most solitary and colonial animals inhabiting marine hard substrata differ fundamentally in their ability to use space. Colonial animals are superior space competitors because (1) indeterminate growth allows continuous lateral substratum occupation without requiring intervening stages of sexual reproduction and recruitment, and (2) they are less susceptible to "fouling" and overgrowth. Solitary animals survive in the seas because (1) various morphological and behavioral attributes (escape in size, aggregative behavior) protect them in spatial competition with colonial animals or because (2) predation, physical disturbance, or competition with plants prevents monopolization of substrata by colonial animals. Focus on ecological strategies circumvents arguments regarding the solitary or colonial identity of problematical groups such as sponges. The evolution of specific competition mechanisms by colonial animals has provided the basis for competitive networks which have further favored the evolution of higher diversity within colonial rather than solitary groups. Recognition of the generalist-specialist and early-late "successional" roles of most solitary versus colonial animals leads to predictions that solitary animals should recruit more heavily and be more palatable to predators than are colonial animals. Preliminary evidence supports these predictions. Note Added in Proof.-Results of Osman's (1977) excellent experimental study of fouling organisms near Woods Hole, Massachusetts, unfortunately appeared too late for inclusion here. His observations on competitive interactions among solitary and colonial animals are in substantial agreement with the conclusions of this paper.

abstract = {Some of the most profound effects of climate change on ecological communities are due to alterations in species interactions rather than direct physiological effects of changing environmental con-ditions. Empirical evidence of historical changes in species inter-actions within climate-impacted communities is, however, rare and difficult to obtain. Here, we demonstrate the recent disappearance of key habitat-forming kelp forests from a warming tropical–tem-perate transition zone in eastern Australia. Using a 10-y video data-set encompassing a 0.6 °C warming period, we show how herbivory increased as kelp gradually declined and then disappeared. Concur-rently, fish communities from sites where kelp was originally abun-dant but subsequently disappeared became increasingly dominated by tropical herbivores. Feeding assays identified two key tropical/ subtropical herbivores that consumed transplanted kelp within hours at these sites. There was also a distinct increase in the abun-dance of fishes that consume epilithic algae, and much higher bite rates by this group at sites without kelp, suggesting a key role for these fishes in maintaining reefs in kelp-free states by removing kelp recruits. Changes in kelp abundance showed no direct relation-ship to seawater temperatures over the decade and were also un-related to other measured abiotic factors (nutrients and storms). Our results show that warming-mediated increases in fish herbivory pose a significant threat to kelp-dominated ecosystems in Australia and, potentially, globally. climate change | macroalgae | plant–herbivore interactions | range shifts |},

Among them, Natural User Interfaces (NUI), i.e. non-intrusive technologies not requiring to the user to wear devices nor use external hardware (e.g. keys or trackballs), are considered a promising way to broader the audience of specific cultural heritage domains, like the navigation/interaction with digital artworks presented on wall-sized displays. Starting from a collaboration with a worldwide famous Italian designer, we defined a NUI to explore 360 panoramic artworks presented on wall-sized displays, like virtual reconstruction of ancient cultural sites, or rendering of imaginary places. Specifically, we let the user to "move the head" as way of natural interaction to explore and navigate through these large digital artworks. To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly. With NUIs, it is difficult to get feedbacks from the users about the interest for the point of the artwork he/she is looking at. To solve this issue, we complemented the gaze estimator with a preliminary emotional analysis solution, able to implicitly infer the interest of the user for the shown content from his/her pupil size. A sample of 150 subjects was invited to experience the proposed interface at an International Design Week. Preliminary results show that the most of the subjects were able to properly interact with the system from the very first use, and that the emotional module is an interesting solution, even if further work must be devoted to address specific situations. {\textcopyright} 2016 for this paper by its authors.

Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehen-sive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geo-graphic variation in trends, with regional variability in the di-rection and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = −0.018 y −1},

abstract = {Two distinct organizational states of kelp forest communities, foliose algal assemblages and deforested barren areas, typically display sharp discontinuities. Mecha- nisms responsible for maintaining these state differences were studied by manipulating various features of their boundary regions. Urchins in the barren areas had significantly smaller gonads than those in adjacent kelp stands, implying that food was a limiting resource for urchins in the barrens. The abundance of drift algae and living foliose algae varied abruptly across the boundary between kelp beds and barren areas. These observations raise the question of why urchins from barrens do not invade kelp stands to improve their fitness. By manipulating kelp and urchin densities at boundary regions and within kelp beds, we tested the hypothesis that kelp stands inhibit invasion of urchins. Urchins that were ex- perimentally added to kelp beds persisted and reduced kelp abundance until winter storms either swept the urchins away or caused them to seek refuge within crevices. Urchins invaded kelp bed margins when foliose algae were removed but were prevented from doing so when kelps were replaced with physical models. The sweeping motion of kelps over the seafloor apparently inhibits urchins from crossing the boundary between kelp stands and barren areas, thus maintaining these alternate stable states. Our findings suggest that kelp stands are able to defend themselves from their most important herbivores by combining their flexible morphology with the energy of wave-generated surge. The inhibitory influence of this interaction may be an important mechanism maintaining the patchwork mosaics of barren areas and kelp beds that characterize many kelp forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Macroalgae are a diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic lower organisms and offer indispensable ecosystem services towards sustainable productivity of rocky coastal areas. The earlier studies have mainly focused on elucidation of the roles of the epiphytic bacterial communities in the ecophysiology of the host macroalga. However, mutualistic interactions have become topic of current interest. It is evident from recent studies that a fraction of epiphytic bacterial communities can be categorized as “core microbial species”, suggesting an obligate association. Epiphytic bacterial communities have also been reported to protect macroalgal surfaces from biofouling microorganisms through production of biologically active metabolites. Because of their intrinsic roles in the host life cycle, the host in turn may provide necessary organic nutrients in order to woo pelagic microbial communities to settle on the host surfaces. However, the precise composition of microbiomes and their functional partnership with hosts are hardly understood. In contrast, the microbial studies associated with human skin and gut and plants have significantly advanced our knowledge on microbiome and their functional interactions with the host. This has led to manipulation of the microbial flora of the human gut and of agricultural plants for improving health and performance. Therefore, it is highly imperative to investigate the functional microbiome that is closely involved in the life cycles of the host macroalgae using high-throughput techniques (metagenomics and metatranscriptomics). The findings from such investigations would help in promoting health and productivity in macroalgal species through regulation of functionally active microbiome.},

abstract = {Aim Global climate change has profound and diverse effects on biological diversity. Identifying present-day climate refugia is an increasingly recognized strategy for the management of biodiversity loss. Such refugia are potential safe havens that enhance environmental diversity by buffering the effects of large scale change, facilitating species persistence at regional scales and conserving unique genetic diversity. Although their ecological effects are well studied, the potential of upwelling centres to act as refugia in a scenario of climate warming remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate whether upwelled waters act as refugia in a region heavily affected by recent climatic changes. Location Shores of south-western Iberia and north-western Africa. Methods We compared changes in distribution of the canopy-forming macroalga Fucus guiryi with sea surface temperature patterns in five upwelling areas and adjacent warmer regions. Population diversity and structure was inferred from genotypic analyses using nine microsatellite loci. Results Fucus guiryi has disappeared from large expanses of non-upwelling shores, currently persisting in areas characterized by strong upwelling and reduced or non-significant rates of warming. Populations of F. guiryi were more abundant towards upwelling centres. Furthermore, the genetic characterization of populations revealed distinct genetic groups associated with each upwelling system. Main conclusions Within a large region of predominantly changing climate, we highlight the fundamental importance of upwelling areas as favourable, comparatively stable climates where F. guiryi has retreated and persists, preserving unique portions of the species' genetic pool.},

Loss of structural complexity is linked to ecosystem declines in biodiversity and resilience. We developed new methods using underwater stereo-imagery spanning 4 years (2010–2013) to reconstruct 3D models of coral reef areas and quantified both structural complexity at two spatial resolutions (2.5 and 25 cm) and benthic community composition to characterize changes after an unprecedented thermal anomaly on the west coast of Australia in 2011. Structural complexity increased at both resolutions in quadrats (4 m2) that bleached, but not those that did not bleach. Changes in complexity were driven by species-specific responses to warming, highlighting the importance of identifying small-scale dynamics to disentangle ecological responses to disturbance. We demonstrate an effective, repeatable method for quantifying the relationship among community composition, structural complexity and ocean warming, improving predictions of the response of marine ecosystems to environmental change.},

abstract = {Global climate change is shifting species distributions worldwide. At rear edges (warmer, low latitude range margins), the consequences of small variations in environmental conditions can be magnified, producing large negative effects on species ranges. A major outcome of shifts in distributions that only recently received attention is the potential to reduce the levels of intra-specific diversity and consequently the global evolutionary and adaptive capacity of species to face novel disturbances. This is particularly important for low dispersal marine species, such as kelps, that generally retain high and unique genetic diversity at rear ranges resulting from long-term persistence, while ranges shifts during climatic glacial/interglacial cycles. Using ecological niche modelling, we (1) infer the major environmental forces shaping the distribution of a cold-temperate kelp, Laminaria hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie, and we (2) predict the effect of past climate changes in shaping regions of long-term persistence (i.e., climatic refugia), where this species might hypothetically harbour higher genetic diversity given the absence of bottlenecks and local extinctions over the long term. We further (3) assessed the consequences of future climate for the fate of L. hyperborea using different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). Results show NW Iberia, SW Ireland and W English Channel, Faroe Islands and S Iceland, as regions where L. hyperborea may have persisted during past climate extremes until present day. All predictions for the future showed expansions to northern territories coupled with the significant loss of suitable habitats at low latitude range margins, where long-term persistence was inferred (e.g., NW Iberia). This pattern was particularly evident in the most agressive scenario of climate change (RCP 8.5), likely driving major biodiversity loss, changes in ecosystem functioning and the impoverishment of the global gene pool of L. hyperborea. Because no genetic baseline is currently available for this species, our results may represent a first step in informing conservation and mitigation strategies.},

Preliminary results are presented from airborne fluid lensing campaigns conducted over the coral reefs of Ofu Island, American Samoa (2013) and the stromatolite reefs of Shark Bay, Western Australia (2014), covering a combined area of 15 km2. These reef ecosystems were revealed with centimetre-scale 2D resolution, and an accompanying 3D bathymetry model was derived using fluid lensing, Structure from Motion and UAV position data. Data products were validated from in situ survey methods including underwater calibration targets, depth measurements and millimetre-scale high-dynamic-range gigapixel photogrammetry.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Fluid lensing is an experimental technology that uses water-transmitting wavelengths to passively image underwater objects at high-resolution by exploiting time-varying optical lensing events caused by surface waves. Fluid lensing data are captured from low-altitude, cost-effective electric UAVs to achieve multispectral imagery and bathymetry models at the centimetre scale over regional areas. As a passive system, fluid lensing is presently limited by signal-to-noise ratio and water column inherent optical properties to {\~{}}10 m depth over visible wavelengths in clear waters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* The datasets derived from fluid lensing present the first centimetre-scale images of a reef acquired from above the ocean surface, without wave distortion. The 3D multispectral data distinguish coral, fish and invertebrates in American Samoa, and reveal previously undocumented, morphologically distinct, stromatolite structures in Shark Bay. These findings suggest fluid lensing and multirotor electric drones represent a promising advance in the remote sensing of aquatic environments at the centimetre scale, or ‘reef scale' relevant to the conservation of reef ecosystems. Pending further development and validation of fluid lensing methods, these technologies present a solution for large-scale 3D surveys of shallow aquatic habitats with centimetre-scale spatial resolution and hourly temporal sampling.$\backslash$nCopyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Spatial and temporal coverage often has to be compromised to make more cost effective the monitoring routine. Nowadays, emerging technologies, can overcome many of these constraints. Here we describe a recent development in remote sensing based on a small unmanned drone (UAVs) that produce very fine scale maps of fish nursery areas. This technology is simple to use, inexpensive, and timely in producing aerial photographs of marine areas. Both technical details regarding aerial photos acquisition (drone and camera settings) and post processing workflow (3D model generation with Structure From Motion algorithm and photo-stitching) are given. Finally by applying modern algorithm of semi-automatic image analysis and classification (Maximum Likelihood, ECHO and Object-based Image Analysis) we compared the results of three thematic maps of nursery area for juvenile sparid fishes, highlighting the potential of this method in mapping and monitoring coastal marine habitats.},

This consultation included an on-line questionnaire, results from a workshop and data provided by a selected group of experts working on kelp forest mapping and eco-evolutionary research. Differences in status and trends according to geographical areas, species identity and small-scale variations within the same habitat where shown by assembling and mapping kelp distribution and trend data. Significant data gaps for some geographical regions, like the Mediterranean and the southern Iberian Peninsula, were also identified. The data used for this study confirmed a general trend with decreasing abundance of some native kelp species at their southern distributional range limits and increasing abundance in other parts of their distribution (Saccharina latissima and Saccorhiza polyschides). The expansion of the introduced species Undaria pinnatifida was also registered. Drivers of observed changes in kelp forests distribution and abundance were assessed using experts' opinions. Multiple possible drivers were identified, including global warming, sea urchin grazing, harvesting, pollution and fishing pressure, and their impact varied between geographical areas. Overall, the results highlight major threats for these ecosystems but also opportunities for conservation. Major requirements to ensure adequate protection of coastal kelp ecosystems along European coastlines are discussed, based on the local to regional gaps detected in the study.},

abstract = {Abstract The coast along the temperate South East Pacific (SEP) presents a simple linear topography with a north-south orientation spanning more than 4600 km. However, environmental heterogeneity associated with two major biogeographic boundaries has been described along the SEP (30–33°S and 42°S). Recent phylo- geographic studies of seaweeds revealed the existence of different cryptic species along the SEP coast and that most of the genetic breaks between them are broadly congruent with the biogeographic boundaries. These phylogeographic patterns characterized by genetic discontinuities could be attributed to historical vicariance or to budding speciation. For SEP seaweeds, two major phylogeographic patterns are observed. Endemic species living north of 42°S show complex haplotype net- works and an almost complete genetic isolation between populations located only a few kilometres from each other. This extreme genetic patchiness has been related to the combined effects of limited dispersal, reduced population size and high popu- lation turnover of these intertidal seaweeds due to stochastic effects of climatic and tectonic catastrophes. On the other hand, species with a range distribution limited to the south of 42°S and inhabiting the area highly affected by the coastal ice cap during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), show typical signatures of post-glacial demographic expansion. Finally, molecular studies reveal that several species are recent immigrants from New Zealand, demonstrating the importance of oceanic dispersal in shaping the diversity of the SEP.},

abstract = {UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or "drones") for routine survey applications at the coast have come of age, and are no longer 'the latest thing' more suited to the specialist researcher or amateur enthusiast. Off-the-shelf, survey-grade UAV equipment, data processing and analysis tools are now readily available to practicing coastal engineers, managers and researchers. Within the regulatory constraints that determine their use in many countries, UAVs provide an efficient and cost-effective survey tool for topographic mapping and measurement in the coastal zone. At the practical level, the specialist training required to operate off-the-shelf UAV suited to coastal surveying is now comparable in time and degree of difficulty to learning how to use the equivalent survey capabilities of professional hand-held RTK-GPS equipment. While incremental improvements to both the flight technology and data processing will no doubt continue to occur, from the coastal practitioner's perspective, no more step changes in UAV technology or ease of useability are required. In particular, survey-grade UAVs that incorporate internal RTK-GPS for high accuracy positioning and requiring a single operator only to safely deploy in the field, remove the need for separate and time-consuming on-ground surveying of ground control points (GCPs), previously required during post-deployment data processing. A coastal engineering application of UAV is used here to exemplify the practical use and potential benefits of this now mature survey technology. Over the past 2 years, rapid post-storm deployment of UAV surveying has been successfully integrated into an established coastal monitoring program spanning 4 decades at Narrabeen Beach, Australia. This has extended the scope of this program to include detailed measurements of dune and beachface erosion spanning the full 3.5 km long embayment at a spatial scale and temporal resolution that were previously unfeasible. For both the researcher and practicing coastal engineer, UAVs now provide a practical option for routine coastal surveying.},

abstract = {Neutral and niche assembly mechanisms structure ecological communities, but their relative importance may depend on the steepness of the environmental gradient. We assess the biogeography of seaweeds along the South African coastline in relation to properties of a steep thermal gradient produced by the Benguela (Atlantic Ocean) and Agulhas (Indian Ocean) Currents. We subdivided the coastline into four ‘bioregions' to test whether the regional patterning of biodiversity was consistent with that seen more broadly. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the distribution and diversity of species, we calculated the rates of change in !-diversity based on the S{\o}rensen dissimilarity (!"{\o}{\$}) as a function of geographical space (50-2,700 km) and Euclidian distance of thermal dissimilarities (dE ), and determined properties such as ‘serial !-diversity,' turnover (!"{\%}{\&}) and nestedness (!"'(). We employ Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) as spatial predictors and used redundancy analysis and variation partitioning to find the relative strengths of thermal, spatial and spatially-structured thermal predictors. Spatial and environmental predictors explained 91.7{\%} of the variation in the seaweed flora, and spatially-structured environmental influences (the thermal gradient) accounted for 58.8{\%} of this combined pool. We found that the Benguela Current influenced west coast region, which generally had a weak thermal gradient, showed a high amount of !"'(, which indicates neutral assembly processes. Along the southern and eastern coastlines, where the Agulhas Current is a major influence, !"{\%}{\&} emerged as the major component of overall !-diversity, suggesting niche influences as dominant structuring forces. Historical factors, such as the intensification of upwelling during the mid-Pliocene 4.6–3.2 Ma, seem responsible for the strong disjunction between the species-poor west coast and species-rich south and east coast floras. This separation continues to maintain two systems of community structuring mechanisms in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean influenced sides of South Africa.},

A power analysis was used to determine the number of samples needed per annum to detect a 5 and 10{\%} increase and decrease in population size. The BRUVs outperformed the nets and traps in terms of sampling effort and were better at detecting changes in abundance of lobster than abundance of three fish species. Considering factors such as cost, analysis time, additional data and environmental impact, traps are the most feasible method in deeper waters but BRUVs could replace nets and traps in depths less than 60 m, low-density areas and marine reserves.},

abstract = {Subtidal forests comprised of kelps and other canopy-forming macroalgae represent critically important marine habitats. Kelp forests exhibit high rates of primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, support high levels of biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. Compared with many other regions, kelp forests around the UK have been largely understudied despite their recognised importance and the possible impacts of environmental change factors. We conducted surveys at 12 kelp-dominated open-coast sites within four regions in the UK, spanning {\~{}}??9?? in latitude and {\~{}}??3????C in mean sea temperature. We used a combination of quadrat-scale abundance and percent cover data as well as transect-scale canopy cover estimates to quantify ecological structure at multiple spatial scales. Kelp forest structure varied significantly between sites (nested within region) and also between regions. Regional-scale differences were principally driven by a higher abundance/cover of Alaria esculenta at the colder northern regions (i.e. north and west Scotland), and the presence of the Lusitanian kelp Laminaria ochroleuca at some sites in the southernmost region (i.e. southwest England) but nowhere else. The kelp Laminaria hyperborea dominated all sites and varied significantly between sites but not regions. All assemblage-level and population-level response variables were highly variable between sites within regions, suggesting that environmental factors varying at corresponding spatial scales (e.g. wave exposure, turbidity, sedimentation) are important drivers of pattern. The detection of regional-scale variability suggests that predicted changes in ocean climate, particularly increased sea temperature, may lead to changes in kelp forest structure in the future, with poleward range contractions (for A. esculenta) and expansions (for L. ochroleuca) likely. However, as the distribution-abundance patterns of the assemblage dominant L. hyperborea did not vary predictably with ocean temperature at this spatial scale, the fundamental structure of these habitats may be more influenced by localised factors, at least in the short-term. The relative importance of multiple, concurrent environmental change factors in structuring UK kelp forests remains largely unknown.},

This study investigates the physiological and transcriptomic responses of the endemic macroalga Desmarestia anceps to a combination of different levels of temperature (2 and 7 degrees C), dissolved CO2 (380 and 1000 ppm), and irradiance (65 and 145 micromol photons m-2 s-1). Growth and photosynthesis increased at high CO2 conditions, and strongly decreased at 2 degrees C plus high irradiance, in comparison to the other treatments. Photoinhibition at 2 degrees C plus high irradiance was evidenced by the photochemical performance and intensive release of dissolved organic carbon. The highest number of differentially regulated transcripts was observed in thalli exposed to 2 degrees C plus high irradiance. Algal 13C isotopic discrimination values suggested an absence of down-regulation of carbon-concentrating mechanisms at high CO2. CO2 enrichment induced few transcriptomic changes. There was high and constitutive gene expression of many photochemical and inorganic carbon utilization components, which might be related to the strong adaptation of D. anceps to the Antarctic environment. These results suggest that increased temperature and CO2 will allow D. anceps to maintain its productivity while tolerating higher irradiances than at present conditions.},

abstract = {Introduction South Africa is the custodian of a marine and coastal environ-ment that is remarkable for its beauty, biotic diversity, and geomorphological features. By its very nature, the coast contrib-utes substantially to the economy of the country, primarily through the fertile adjacent farmlands, its cities, ports and holiday resorts, as well as through the harvesting of marine resources and products. It is estimated that at least 35{\%} of South Africa's gross domestic product is generated in the coastal regions. 1 Recent years have seen an influx of people to the coast, and current estimates are that one-third of the population resides within 60 km of the seashore. 1 This places environmental pressure on the coastal systems, inevitably increasing the threat of their degradation, including that relating to pollution. The implementation of management procedures necessary to reduce the effects of pollution should be based on sound scientific principles. The primary objective of the study reported here was to assess the scientific basis for marine pollution monitoring in South Africa, and thereby to decide whether research on the ecological effects of marine pollution is adequate and appropriate. Pollution-monitoring projects currently being undertaken in South Africa are extremely diverse in their objectives and practice. By far the majority are linked to impact assessment studies by local authorities (municipalities) or private consul-tants, to meet town and regional planning requirements. Other consultancies concern local industries, or port authorities, in order to meet state requirements, or international protocols, such as the London Convention. 2 These types of projects are often narrowly focused. In considering immediate issues using standard procedures, their contextual frameworks limit inter-pretation of data, and their objectives contribute little to the development of scientific and technological knowledge. Globally, pollution studies have been at the forefront of marine biological research in recent years. Pollution monitoring in marine environments is underpinned by a growing body of theoretical science. The methods are subject to continual refine-ment, inevitably allowing greater accessibility of information on, and better understanding of, pollutant effects. 3,4 While the theory may be broadly applicable, much of the application relates to local circumstances, hence the need for local research initiatives to account for the considerable variability in effects relating to different geographical (temperatures, ocean currents) and ecological (taxa and communities) conditions. 5 Although the South Africa's inshore environment is thought to be largely pristine, this impression has never been substantiated, and comprehensive data on how pollutants vary in time and space remain unavailable. Furthermore, we know very little about the general ecological implications of local pollution events, specifi-cally, how harbour extinctions may affect regional populations. The apparent neglect of scientific investigation of marine pollution, in recent times, is surprising considering South Africa's strong marine biological research culture. 6,7 The current study explores this supposition, specifically assessing the ade-quacy and appropriateness of recent marine pollution research endeavours. We examine research trends over the past forty years, based on analyses of the primary literature, and include a bibliography. Methods Primary data were drawn from published work (mainly journal articles) concerning marine pollution from studies undertaken in South Africa between 1960 and the present day. Unpublished reports, including numerous investigations by environmental consultants (private and otherwise), were omit-ted from this analysis for two reasons. Many of these reports are not accessible to the public at large, and are generally not relevant to the objective of evaluating the development of scien-tific research and technology. While the focus of the study was on biological organisms (animals, plants and microbes) and ecological effects, the analyses incorporated all the published scientific papers retrieved (including non-biological ones). The latter were not considered for discussion. The South African National Research Programme Reports, published by the Foundation for Research Development, however, are generally available to the public and are included in the bibliography. The search engines used were Web of Science, ScienceDirect, OCLC First Search and EBSCO. Keywords included combina-tions of the following terms: marine, estuarine, coast, pollution, South Africa, sewage, organic, bacteria, coliforms, chemical, industrial, oil, petroleum, hydrocarbon, DDT, dieldrin, PCB, organochlorine, metal, cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, tin, sediment, radioactive, nuclear, thermal, plastic, litter, outfall, stormwater, bioaccumulation, biomonitoring, bioindication and ecotoxicology. Wildcard characters with truncated keywords enabled the capture of variations of the above keywords. The basic information recorded for each article included: (1) the year in which the article was published, (2) the region where the study was undertaken, and (3) the nature of the investiga-tion, including the type of pollutant being investigated. In order to present the data as a time-frequency distribution, each article was grouped into a five-year class. Distinction was made between investigations undertaken in response to a crisis, such as an oil spill (reactive), and those independently motivated. Reactive studies were considered only in the initial temporal analysis and were excluded from other data sets.

abstract = {Nutrient enrichment as a result of anthropogenic activity concentrated along the land-sea margin is increasing eutrophication of near-shore waters across the globe. Management of eutrophication in the coastal zone has been ' hampered by the lack of a direct method to trace nitrogen sources from land into coastal food webs. Stable isotope data from a series of estuaries receiving nitrogen loads from 2 to 467 kg N ha-' yr-' from the Waquoit Bay watershed, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, indicate that producer and consumer 15N-to-14N ratios record increases in wastewater nitrogen inputs. Nitrate from groundwater-borne wastewater introduces a ' " N-enriched tracer to estuaries. This study explicitly links anthropogenically derived nitrogen from watersheds to nitrogen in estuarine plants and animals, and suggests that wastewater nitrogen may be detectable in estuarine biota at relatively low loading rates, before eutrophication leads to major changes in species composition and abundance within estuarine food webs.},

abstract = {Wildlife Conservation Society Punta Gorda Belize rgraham@wcs.org 2 Introduction Sharks and rays, collectively known as elasmobranchs, are unquestionably one of the most endangered assemblages of marine species known and the lack of information on sharks to establish effective management and conservation frameworks is greatly lacking in most parts of the world. Time and logistical difficulties often preclude long term sampling using techniques such as longlines for catch per unit effort, a key metric to assess patterns of relative abundance, diversity and the intraspecific demographics of sharks. Consequently, a relatively new technique that is particularly suited to rapid assessments has emerged that can further help to fill gaps in knowledge of species diversity and relative abundance. Baited remote underwater video set-­‐ups (BRUV) have been recently used to characterize predatory fish assemblages and the role of habitat structure on their abundances and diversity in a non-­‐invasive manner [1]. The Swan Islands, a remote outcrop on the edge of the Cayman Trench located northeast of Honduras' Bay Islands may represent one of the last pristine coral reef sites in the Western Caribbean. Remotely situated far from the Honduran coast and benefiting from protective legislation since 1991 (Government of Honduras 3056-­‐ 91) and a constant terrestrial presence of the Honduran Navy, the islands are expected by scientists and conservationists to reveal positive site and species differences in fauna and flora compared to other protected and unprotected sites that are monitored throughout the Caribbean. The purpose of this study was to therefore to rapidly and non-­‐invasively assess the diversity and relative abundance of elasmobranchs at the Swan Islands, data that would contribute to their management and protection at that site. Methods Sampling took place over the course of three days following a day-­‐long set up and calibration of the BRUVs. Four units were constructed using precut PVC, wood, rope, lead weights and zinc. Cameras used were GoPro Naked cameras (GoPro, Colorado, USA) with flatport housing and red corrective filters. Bait arms consisted of two empty beer cans filled with {\~{}}300g of little tunny (Euthynnus alleteratus) and lionfish (Pterois volitans) secured to the arm using chicken wire and plastic covered wire. The four BRUV units were deployed at 16 stations throughout the Swan Islands. Sampling took place on both the north or leeward side and south or windward side of Great and Little Swan Islands as well as near the channel bisecting the two islands. Each paired deployments represented two stations and two depth regimens. Depths roughly coincided with shallow (10m-­‐14m) and deeper (18m-­‐25m) bathymetric contours and represented the same mixed patch reef, and seagrass habitat throughout. Efforts were made to replicate the stations as many times as 3 possible during the field trip, with up to four replicates for specific stations. Each unit was lowered to the seabed off the back deck of the boat and guided into place by a snorkeler. A GPS mark was taken and sampling of the water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen was taken throughout the island waters using a YSI environmental parameter sampling instrument (YSI, USA). Each deployment was run continuously for 60{\textless} minutes before the unit was lifted back on deck, the cameras removed and the data cards downloaded and batteries recharged. Video was processed with footage truncated to the first 60 minutes of the deployment. Sharks were recorded by species, sexed (where possible) and size estimates were derived when possible using the beer cans as scale. Catch per unit effort was derived as the number of sharks per hour. (shark hr -­‐1).},
